Today,as i was leaving for work in the morning,i had a tire burst in the middle of a busy road. That scared the hell out of me!	hit:3_conv:6_1_6
Are you fine now?	hit:3_conv:6_2_7
Yeah,i'm doing alright now, but with minor injuries.	hit:3_conv:6_3_6
Cool :) Is your car damaged a lot?	hit:3_conv:6_4_7
The car was badly damaged,i veered outside the road and hit a tree trunk. next thing is insurance follow up.	hit:3_conv:6_5_6
A few weeks ago, I was walking through my hallway, minding my own business, when all of a sudden a hand reached out from under a table and grabbed my ankle. I was so suprised. I thought i was got. Turns out, it was my son. 	hit:4_conv:9_1_8
That's funny, hope he didn't give you a heart attack.	hit:4_conv:9_2_4
I may have let out a scream that will have him question my manhood for the rest of our lives, lol. 	hit:4_conv:9_3_8
I would probably scream also.	hit:4_conv:9_4_4
"I'm overly excited because will be flying outside the country for the first time tomorrow."".  Please enter here..."	hit:6_conv:12_1_6
Wow! That sounds amazing. Where are you going? 	hit:6_conv:12_2_11
Traveling to South Africa then to Ghana. Also my first time visiting Africa	hit:6_conv:12_3_6
You are going to love it I am sure. Safe Travels! 	hit:6_conv:12_4_11
One time, I was holding my son over my head, when all of a sudden, he threw up all over my face. I almost cried.	hit:8_conv:17_1_8
Thats horrible, hope he is ok.	hit:8_conv:17_2_4
yeah, he had just drank a bottle, and I was moving him around like an airplane. In retrospect. I deserved it.	hit:8_conv:17_3_8
I see, glad he is ok.	hit:8_conv:17_4_4
Hello	hit:9_conv:18_1_12
Hi, how are you?	hit:9_conv:18_2_10
Im doing great i just wanted to tell you a short story about a time i helped an elderly lady.  She was struggling to carry her bags from a trip she had took.  I helped her carry them to her door ! Pretty good feeling when you help others 	hit:9_conv:18_3_12
That was kind of you, I am sure they appreciated that!	hit:9_conv:18_4_10
I went to the Kemah boardwalk with my boyfriend. It made me think of times I went vacationing with my family.	hit:10_conv:20_1_13
My last vacation went horribly wrongQ!	hit:10_conv:20_2_14
All I thought about was being at home again and being able to relive those moments.	hit:10_conv:20_3_13
Yes I love to reminice	hit:10_conv:20_4_14
My dog died a few years ago after I had my son.  It was right around Christmas and I had the dog for fourteen years.	hit:19_conv:38_1_26
Im sorry to hear that. I have never had a dog. What was your experience of the dog?	hit:19_conv:38_2_18
The dog was there with my throughout my life. He saw me through boyfriends and friends.	hit:19_conv:38_3_26
I am really sorry to hear that. What was the dogs name?	hit:19_conv:38_4_18
hello	hit:31_conv:62_1_44
Hello How are you and what is your story chat about today? 	hit:31_conv:62_2_11
I locked my keys in my car about a week ago. It was 95 degrees outside and I was at the store getting groceries.	hit:31_conv:62_3_44
OMG wow.... i hope you got it open quick! 	hit:31_conv:62_4_11
luckily there are police who patrol around the mall on the other end of the parking lot. one of them got it open for me	hit:31_conv:62_5_44
Hello	hit:34_conv:68_1_12
Hi, a few months ago, my mother found some stray dogs that were starving, so she told us about them. Of course, we brought the poor babies to our house, a mother dog and her two puppies. My heart went out to them, as their ribs were showing, but they were still so loving and sweet.	hit:34_conv:68_2_45
Oh no im so sorry to hear that :/ Thats good that you took them in 	hit:34_conv:68_3_12
Yes, I really felt so much sympathy for them and we all really liked them. We already had several pets, so I wasn't going to keep them, but I wanted to help them get better and find them a good home. We did for all of them, with the puppies being able to stay together.	hit:34_conv:68_4_45
I wanted to let you know recently i saw a younger man helping an old lady who fell to the ground. Its nice to see people helping others	hit:38_conv:77_1_12
That is really nice to see... I bet it made you feel good! So sweet. 	hit:38_conv:77_2_11
yeah it made me feel great :)	hit:38_conv:77_3_12
Nice to still see that behavior in todays world. :)	hit:38_conv:77_4_11
So this one time my grandmother gave me a scooter, it was the best gift ever, I was really happy	hit:51_conv:102_1_51
Thats sweet that you remember that, how old were you? 	hit:51_conv:102_2_11
I was around 10 years old I think, it was quite a long time ago for me now haha!	hit:51_conv:102_3_51
I wont make you reveal your age! lol :p 	hit:51_conv:102_4_11
Hah appreciated, have you ever received a fun gift?	hit:51_conv:102_5_51
I was extremely lucky when my girlfriend said she would date me, she is my world now.	hit:55_conv:110_1_51
That's wonderful. How long have you guys been dating?	hit:55_conv:110_2_1
We have been together for close to 5 months now, so not very long haha!	hit:55_conv:110_3_51
Time flies by pretty fast. Could be together 10 years from now!	hit:55_conv:110_4_1
I hope so haha, are you dating anyone?	hit:55_conv:110_5_51
I started a new job about a month ago and it's going really well.	hit:108_conv:217_1_51
congratualtions. what do you do?	hit:108_conv:217_2_27
I work in I.T. for the provincial government in Canada :)	hit:108_conv:217_3_51
oh wow. we're practically neighbors.	hit:108_conv:217_4_27
So my friend built a deck and it turned out amazing, I didn't know he had it in him.	hit:113_conv:226_1_51
How big was the deck?	hit:113_conv:226_2_4
I think its probably about 20 feet by 25 feet? I'm bad at guessing that kind of stuff hah	hit:113_conv:226_3_51
Wow that is big.	hit:113_conv:226_4_4
My girlfriends really quiet and she tends to scare me a lot.	hit:119_conv:239_1_51
What is scary about what she is doing? I'm not quite understanding what you mean.	hit:119_conv:239_2_55
Well, when shes dealing with her own personal issues she tends to kind of just vanish, I haven't talked to her in a few days and it's making me worry.	hit:119_conv:239_3_51
Oh wow, I can see why you're worrying. You should really talk to her about all this if she comes around soon.	hit:119_conv:239_4_55
I have to fill out forms all day so I scripted a program that does half of it for me and it works really well!	hit:121_conv:243_1_51
Thats great. Did you create the script?	hit:121_conv:243_2_4
Yeah, had to google a bit of it but it worked out well.	hit:121_conv:243_3_51
I love google. It is my favorite search engine.	hit:121_conv:243_4_4
I was extremely relieved when I found out my dad beat cancer.	hit:123_conv:247_1_51
Thats wonderful news! Its such a nasty disease! How long has he been clear? 	hit:123_conv:247_2_11
About 2 years now.	hit:123_conv:247_3_51
Well I hope he has 100 more years to go! :) 	hit:123_conv:247_4_11
My girlfriend hasn't talked to me in a few days and I'm struggling to keep it together but I am at the moment.	hit:125_conv:251_1_51
Have you tried to call her?	hit:125_conv:251_2_4
I have, but she's going through a rough time and likes to seclude herself.	hit:125_conv:251_3_51
Maybe give her space.	hit:125_conv:251_4_4
My grandma gave me a stone and said it was my birthstone and I hold it very close to my heart now.	hit:127_conv:254_1_51
What birthstone is it.	hit:127_conv:254_2_4
It is amethyst.	hit:127_conv:254_3_51
What birthstone is it?	hit:127_conv:254_4_4
I play some competitive video games and I think I'm pretty good at one of them.	hit:128_conv:256_1_51
I love to play Madden.	hit:128_conv:256_2_4
Do you play Madden often?	hit:128_conv:256_3_51
Yes, every day.	hit:128_conv:256_4_4
I haven't been able to talk to my girlfriend in a few days and it's making me quite sad.	hit:131_conv:262_1_51
Where is she?	hit:131_conv:262_2_4
She's in the same city as me, but she's going through a hard time and has decided to seclude herself so I can't reach her.	hit:131_conv:262_3_51
Just give her space.	hit:131_conv:262_4_4
My daughter is very smart. She learns things really quickly.	hit:140_conv:281_1_13
Thats great.	hit:140_conv:281_2_4
Yes, she picks up on things that I didn't even think she knew about.	hit:140_conv:281_3_13
Did you teach her?	hit:140_conv:281_4_4
I can't believe how big the waves are. Hurricane Chris amped up my summer.	hit:146_conv:292_1_60
Did you stay and ride it out? I bet it was quite a thing to see!	hit:146_conv:292_2_61
Yes, I've been surfing for ever. Only three of us in the water. 	hit:146_conv:292_3_60
That must be so much fun. I have never surfed but love to be on a boat. 	hit:146_conv:292_4_61
You are never to old to start. I'm teaching my mate and he is 70 I think. Hopefully I have a boat soon.'	hit:146_conv:292_5_60
Wow I hope I am fit enough at 70 to surf!	hit:146_conv:292_6_61
I usually hate to ask for help, so when my friends all surprised me by taking turns bringing us meals for 2 weeks after my 4th child was born I was blown away. I was so relieved to have help. 	hit:146_conv:293_1_61
Wow, 4 children my first is on the way and I'm freaking out. You must have great friends.  	hit:146_conv:293_2_60
That is so exciting, congratulations! We moved 17 hours away from family, so having a great group of friends is really important to us. 	hit:146_conv:293_3_61
Thank You. That is our next step we are moving from NYC to Miami after the baby. How can we find friends like yours? 	hit:146_conv:293_4_60
Get involved in something. Church, a social club for interests you are in. I don't recommend parent groups, for some reason they get really nasty. Just find a way to connect with people. Having children is so much harder without a support system!	hit:146_conv:293_5_61
I see what you mean about a parents group. I joined a dads group in facebook and it's full of people who complain non stop about  being an adult. 	hit:146_conv:293_6_60
I went to this thing called a Paint Night and I ended up making an okay looking painting	hit:158_conv:317_1_51
That sounds fun, I was never any good at painting	hit:158_conv:317_2_10
I am not either, but they had an instructor to follow along to! :)	hit:158_conv:317_3_51
That probably helps a good deal!	hit:158_conv:317_4_10
That Jerk, Did'nt even wave when he cut me off. 	hit:159_conv:319_1_60
I wish I had a rubber bumper to ram those people with!	hit:159_conv:319_2_10
After the Apocalypse I'll just ran them off the road. To make things worse he was in a Horse and Buggy. 	hit:159_conv:319_3_60
That is terrible, he could have hurt the horse!	hit:159_conv:319_4_10
That's what me the most mad. It's like he did not care at all. 	hit:159_conv:319_5_60
So I got a new job recently, and I got my first paycheck and it was pretty good compared to what I was expecting!	hit:161_conv:323_1_51
Nice, congratulations. How are you liking the new job itself?	hit:161_conv:323_2_35
It's pretty good so far, I think I'm gonna like it for the long haul!	hit:161_conv:323_3_51
Awesome, I hope the job goes great for you!	hit:161_conv:323_4_35
When I was a little girl, our cat ran away and was gone so long we didn't think he would come home so we adopted another kitten. 	hit:162_conv:324_1_61
Thats sad, hopefully the new cat got to live a long and full life with you	hit:162_conv:324_2_63
Well, we had a funny twist. The same day we brought the new kitten home, or old cat showed up. We kind of thought maybe he was hanging out close to home and was mad that we replaced him.	hit:162_conv:324_3_61
Haha thats crazy, I hope they became best friends, I love cats.	hit:162_conv:324_4_63
I really liked having my mom here. She helped with the kids but then when she left I missed it.	hit:164_conv:329_1_13
I can imagine! That extra set of hands -- and a person you can *trust* -- that's the best!	hit:164_conv:329_2_66
Yes, the kids really missed her when she left. It took us a while to get back to the normal around here.	hit:164_conv:329_3_13
Does she live far away? It sounds like maybe visits aren't too frequent.	hit:164_conv:329_4_66
This one time I spent an entire hour waiting for food at dennys.	hit:166_conv:332_1_51
An hour? Damn for somewhere as meh as Denny's that really isn't worth it.	hit:166_conv:332_2_55
Its really not, the foods not worth that long of a wait.	hit:166_conv:332_3_51
I haven't been there in so long for that exact reason.	hit:166_conv:332_4_55
I went to a nice work dinner with my husband. I can't get over how stupid I made myself look. 	hit:167_conv:335_1_61
Oh really? What happened that made you look bad?	hit:167_conv:335_2_63
I went to the bathroom real fast before we went into the dining room. I tucked my dress into my panty hose and didn't even notice. I walked past everyone with my underwear showing. I'm sure I'll laugh about it... someday. 	hit:167_conv:335_3_61
Oof yea that seems like it might take a few years or 10 before you can laugh at it but at least its over.	hit:167_conv:335_4_63
A lady was having issues with a program on her computer, and I solved it with no problems!	hit:168_conv:336_1_51
That's awesome! My experience was quite opposite as I sat waiting in the dentist chair for a 2 1/2 hour procedure!	hit:168_conv:336_2_67
That sounds unpleasant, did you get in afterwards?	hit:168_conv:336_3_51
Yes! I'm actually glad it's over :) So, how long did it take you to fix the computer problem?	hit:168_conv:336_4_67
I'm so angry they end up charging me 255 in charges that did not belong to me.  	hit:169_conv:338_1_60
Yeah, that is pretty annoying to have happen.	hit:169_conv:338_2_68
I called them and did not hold back. 	hit:169_conv:338_3_60
Good man! That is your money and they just wanna snatch from you.	hit:169_conv:338_4_68
I was going to go down and go nuts but my wife stopped me. 	hit:169_conv:338_5_60
My friend was telling me about teaching jobs to apply for. I didn't get hired, but she got one right off the bat!	hit:171_conv:343_1_13
It sounds like you're happy for her, which is commendable given you didn't get hired. Were you very disappointed?	hit:171_conv:343_2_66
I was kind of envious that she got the job and I didn't because it seemed like I was more qualified than she was.	hit:171_conv:343_3_13
That's always tough. It's so hard to tell what other factors come into play in situations like that. Are you happy where you're currently at, or still looking?	hit:171_conv:343_4_66
My girlfriend has some mental health issues and sometimes ends up in the hospital, and I go and see her as often as I can.	hit:177_conv:355_1_51
I'm so sorry about that. It sounds like you're doing your best to be supportive.	hit:177_conv:355_2_71
Thanks, I am definitely trying to be as supportive as I can, she's my world.	hit:177_conv:355_3_51
She's very lucky to have you. I wish you guys the best!	hit:177_conv:355_4_71
I love going to places that I explored and play at as a child. Every time I go, I always feel super nostalgic.	hit:182_conv:365_1_8
I am very nostalgic too, that must be a fun time!	hit:182_conv:365_2_10
Yes, until you realize that it was 20 years since you played there, and you start feeling old	hit:182_conv:365_3_8
That is true, but it is part of life, but it is cool to see things again, regain perspective	hit:182_conv:365_4_10
I hope this doesn't make me sound like a horrible boyfriend, but when my girlfriend first moved into my house, I felt very apprehensive towards the move at first. I was used to it being one way, and she was changing everything. Took some getting used to.	hit:184_conv:368_1_8
I'm sure it did! It's not easy to have to adapt to another person's habits.	hit:184_conv:368_2_72
I know. It caused some tension the first week or so. I had to take a deep breath, and realize its just things, and it was just me being reluctant to change. 	hit:184_conv:368_3_8
Yes, sometimes we have to learn to let go of the little things so we can appreciate the more important things. It sounds like you have done a great job!	hit:184_conv:368_4_72
I always hate thinking that my son is getting old. Just like a few days ago, I was looking at some of my sons old clothes, and it made me very sentimental. I never want him to get old on me. 	hit:185_conv:370_1_8
I believe you are really sad although it's a fact of life	hit:185_conv:370_2_73
Yes. You get to see them change and grow. It makes it all worth it. 	hit:185_conv:370_3_8
True, and the good thing is that when the kids grow, they provide moral support to parents.	hit:185_conv:370_4_73
I love a good surprise like anyone else; however, when my girlfriend waited until 8 pm on my birthday to tell me happy birthday and give me a present, I was caught off guard. I thought she had forgot. 	hit:190_conv:380_1_8
Maybe she did and remembered last minute. You should ask her!	hit:190_conv:380_2_60
She remembered but was trying to draw it out to make me think that she had forgot. I should have known because I made her wait until 10 pm on her birthday.	hit:190_conv:380_3_8
Next year I would just forget her birthday all together!	hit:190_conv:380_4_60
I work two full time jobs and he stays at home all day, Not Fair!	hit:190_conv:381_1_60
Is he a stay at home father, or does he just not want to work?	hit:190_conv:381_2_8
He's 20 he just wants to party and sleep.	hit:190_conv:381_3_60
I am sorry to hear that. Maybe as he gets older he will get his priorities in order and see how hard you work.	hit:190_conv:381_4_8
Doubtful, he's a punk!	hit:190_conv:381_5_60
So the other day was my 23rd Birthday! I had no idea what my friends had planned but i walked into a room, a room which i thought was empty as the lights were all off, and all my friends jumped out and yelled happy birthday! It was such a shock, and felt so nice to have people who cared deeply about me provide me with such an experience! 	hit:199_conv:398_1_79
Must of been pretty surprised, Also great to have friends like that.	hit:199_conv:398_2_68
It really was! They even had my favorite kind of cake, chocolate mousse from my favorite bakery! 	hit:199_conv:398_3_79
That must of just made everything even better!	hit:199_conv:398_4_68
Right?! I mean who doesn't love cake. But that's not even the best part. on the counter, there was a HUGE pile of presents calling my name. 	hit:199_conv:398_5_79
I'm thrilled. I got a raise!	hit:202_conv:405_1_60
That is a great news. You surely have done a great job.	hit:202_conv:405_2_7
Best Ever. I didn't have a clue I was going to get it. I just walked in and boom got a raise.	hit:202_conv:405_3_60
You are very lucky	hit:202_conv:405_4_7
Your not kidding and to think I was going to quit. 	hit:202_conv:405_5_60
"Have you seen the film ""within"" on netflix? The other night my boyfriend and i watched it and I had trouble sleeping afterwards, it was pretty creepy!"	hit:205_conv:410_1_79
No I haven't actually, I recently just canceled my netflix service! I have been thinking about resubscribing though. 	hit:205_conv:410_2_83
"Why did you cancel your subscription? If you ever re-subscribe i would definetly recommend checking out ""within""!"	hit:205_conv:410_3_79
I could not find the content that was best suited for me personally to consider it worthy at the time, but if I do I will definitely check it out!	hit:205_conv:410_4_83
I spilt wed wine on my moms red carpet and blamed it on the cat	hit:206_conv:413_1_79
Was the color of red that different to show on the red carpet?	hit:206_conv:413_2_68
Very! It was a dark maroon stain. 	hit:206_conv:413_3_79
Oh! wow that must of been pretty obvious then.	hit:206_conv:413_4_68
My wife is angry and I don't know what to say. My anniversary was yesterday and I had no clue!	hit:208_conv:416_1_60
Argh! That's tough! Have you been able to come from a place of authentic apology? It can be easy to be defensive in those situations, which of course only makes it worse!	hit:208_conv:416_2_66
I'm still working on it. she has has not given me much of a chance. 	hit:208_conv:416_3_60
"What's your approach? Does humor ever work....? You know, like wearing a dunce cap while holding a huge bouquet of flowers? Or going John Cusack and holding a boombox overhead, playing ""your"" song?"	hit:208_conv:416_4_66
I used diamond earrings. 	hit:208_conv:416_5_60
So the other night my boyfriend and I were out socializing at a networking event and another woman went up to him and touched his arm I coudn't help but feel a little envious even though he pulled away.	hit:209_conv:418_1_79
You should not be so insecure like that.	hit:209_conv:418_2_75
Its not about insecurity! 	hit:209_conv:418_3_79
What is about them? Do you think he is better than you?	hit:209_conv:418_4_75
Have you ever been to Las Vegas? 	hit:210_conv:420_1_79
yes, several times.The place is magical.	hit:210_conv:420_2_75
I'm actually going for the first time in my adult life this fall! I'm really excited!	hit:210_conv:420_3_79
Well, you are about to have the fun of your life, but gamble responsible.	hit:210_conv:420_4_75
I was thinking about my boyfriends wedding proposal the other night, it had left me in absolute shock. I did not expect him to get down on one knee and propose.	hit:215_conv:430_1_79
Why. Did you started dating recently or something	hit:215_conv:430_2_75
No we'd been dating a very long time but he was never the traditional kind. Never wanted an official ceremony but after meeting me i guess it all changed!	hit:215_conv:430_3_79
The most important thing is what you want.	hit:215_conv:430_4_75
I'm one of the best surfers that has ever hit the beach. I ride giants.	hit:216_conv:433_1_60
Really?? are you famous then? What is your name?	hit:216_conv:433_2_75
Yes, you can google me.	hit:216_conv:433_3_60
Are you still competing on a professional level?	hit:216_conv:433_4_75
Nope, I've got a family now to support so I surf less and work more. But I've still got killer moves. 	hit:216_conv:433_5_60
I can't believe the bottom of the bag ripped and my wonderful taco's covered the ground. I'm sure my face was bright red with anger.	hit:217_conv:435_1_60
NOT THE TACOS!!!! Seriously, I can understand how frustrating that is. Especially when you have the taste for something.....then gone!	hit:217_conv:435_2_66
It's not like I could back in. I waited in line 20 minutes and had been looking forward to them all day. I had to skip lunch due to work being busy. I'm still mad.	hit:217_conv:435_3_60
Even worse. I'm so sorry. What did you do instead?	hit:217_conv:435_4_66
A bowl of dry cereal. 	hit:217_conv:435_5_60
Laughing *and* crying for you! Next time!	hit:217_conv:435_6_66
Text time I'm going to treat those sweet fatty taco's like the baby of Jesus. I get heated up just thinking of it.	hit:217_conv:435_7_60
I wish I could emoticon this whole thing.....a string of cry-laughing. I wish I could treat you to lunch there!	hit:217_conv:435_8_66
Have you ever participated in any races, half or full marathons? 	hit:220_conv:440_1_79
I have not! I used to run a lot for soccer practices. Have you?	hit:220_conv:440_2_64
I have not either! My best friend recently recovered from a broken leg and just completed her first full marathon, it was inspirational!	hit:220_conv:440_3_79
That's great for her. 	hit:220_conv:440_4_64
I am not afraid to admit this: I am 32 and afraid of the dark. The other day, my electricity went out due to a storm. It was dark, I couldn't find my phone or a light, so I screamed for my girlfriend to wake up. Am I embarrassed to say that, not at all, lol	hit:223_conv:447_1_8
hahaha thats funny why are you still afraid of the dark?	hit:223_conv:447_2_93
I am not scared of the dark. I am just scared of the things in the dark. And the ironic thing is, I don't even believe in the supernatural, so I am scared of the dark to just be scared of it, I think. 	hit:223_conv:447_3_8
OOO so you think something else is hiding in the dark and that's why your scared?	hit:223_conv:447_4_93
Nope. I am just scared that in case there is the supernatural. It makes sense in my head;however, when I am saying it out loud, it doesnt, lol	hit:223_conv:447_5_8
Before I applied at Inline I really did some background research on the company and what all they were involved in.	hit:227_conv:454_1_97
That's probably the best thing to do before you go to work for a place. Were you happy with your results?	hit:227_conv:454_2_45
I was!  It ended up securing me the job because the company itself is small so the CEO and interviewer were really impressed..	hit:227_conv:454_3_97
Sometimes it's the extra step someone is willing to do that will make it. Good for you!	hit:227_conv:454_4_45
Thank you!  I really enjoy this position a lot so I am happy it turned out well.	hit:227_conv:454_5_97
My husband hangs steel and the last time he had to go work in another state I felt really lost and alone for a bit.	hit:230_conv:461_1_97
I feel the same way when I'm away from my cat.  Does he have to travel a lot for work?	hit:230_conv:461_2_85
Sometimes he does.  Lately there hasn't been any local work so he has had to go out of state and its just too far to come back.	hit:230_conv:461_3_97
Maybe one day if you have the time, you can pay him a surprise visit.	hit:230_conv:461_4_85
That is a good idea! I'll have to sneak his work schedule and give it a try.	hit:230_conv:461_5_97
I made it on time to the bus stop.	hit:234_conv:468_1_101
That is good. Where you running late	hit:234_conv:468_2_102
I was running late and so did the bus.	hit:234_conv:468_3_101
That sucks. I hate when I am running late I always feel behind	hit:234_conv:468_4_102
So I kind of ate the last piece of pizza that we had and I didn't know Tom wanted it... Feeling kinda bad.	hit:235_conv:470_1_97
I don't think you should feel bad, you didn't know!	hit:235_conv:470_2_99
Yeah but he just seemed so disappointed when he came home for lunch.	hit:235_conv:470_3_97
I'm sure he will be okay. Maybe you can make it up to him.	hit:235_conv:470_4_99
I should probably just buy him another pizza soon.	hit:235_conv:470_5_97
Sounds like a good idea.	hit:235_conv:470_6_99
I will start off saying I hate the water! I can't stand being in it; however, that changed last week when I took my son to his first pool. His joy erased all my hatred for water. 	hit:236_conv:472_1_8
Aw. Children will make us do things we NEVER thought we would (or could) do! 	hit:236_conv:472_2_72
Yes! I start swimming lessons next week. I have went 32 years without knowing how to swim, and that one visit changed all that. 	hit:236_conv:472_3_8
That is SO exciting! Congratulations! You are a fabulous role model for your son.	hit:236_conv:472_4_72
Oh today I heard one of Nannie's favorite songs on the radio.  It made me really miss our car rides together.  	hit:237_conv:474_1_97
Oh that's so sweet. My grandmother is a great person too and I'm glad to know her.	hit:237_conv:474_2_100
She was a lovely lady indeed!  I miss our time together a lot especially when I hear the music she used to listen to.	hit:237_conv:474_3_97
I think it's great that you have such positive memories of her, that way she'll always be there in some form.	hit:237_conv:474_4_100
Do you go visit some place that makes you miss growing up?	hit:238_conv:476_1_60
Yes, I love to visit the zoo!  	hit:238_conv:476_2_103
I recently went back to Michigan and got visit my old town and even the High school I had such great times back then.	hit:238_conv:476_3_60
What were some of your favorite things to do back in highschool?	hit:238_conv:476_4_103
I played Football all 4 years, used to Skateboard in the parking lot and hang out in the auto shop. The good old days.	hit:238_conv:476_5_60
My mother was always there for me when I was sick, annoyed and sad	hit:243_conv:487_1_101
That is wonderful!. It is always nice to have at least one good parent.	hit:243_conv:487_2_99
Well my dad too but my mum was so much more, even when I was naughty she was still there.	hit:243_conv:487_3_101
My mom was pretty awesome too! I'm glad you had a good one as well.	hit:243_conv:487_4_99
When I was little I got chased by a large dog and now that I'm much older the feeling is still the same. 	hit:244_conv:489_1_101
That is bad. Are you still afraid a lot?	hit:244_conv:489_2_7
I am, everytime I see a dog, I begin to run the other direction instantly	hit:244_conv:489_3_101
You need to fight your fear	hit:244_conv:489_4_7
I actually have no friends, can you believe that? I'm ok with it though.	hit:249_conv:499_1_108
wow that's very sad!  I am really sorry!	hit:249_conv:499_2_103
No, it's not sad. I really like to be alone, as i'm an introvert. I need my space.	hit:249_conv:499_3_108
Well I guess if that is something you enjoy.  I can't say that I have alot of friends.  Mostly my friends are family 	hit:249_conv:499_4_103
Well in that case, I have a few friends. Outside of family, I don't. 	hit:249_conv:499_5_108
Do you ever find it hard to see at night when it's raining?	hit:250_conv:500_1_108
Yes I do actually, I was almost in an accident because of rain at night once. 	hit:250_conv:500_2_109
That's so scary! I am always on edge in those cases. I hydroplaned really bad last time.	hit:250_conv:500_3_108
I'm glad you were okay and nothing bad happened. 	hit:250_conv:500_4_109
Thank you. I've never been in a traffic accident. Thank goodness for that.	hit:250_conv:500_5_108
I was eating at a restaurant and as I was leaving, an employee there gave me my phone which I had left behind	hit:254_conv:508_1_111
Oh that was so nice of them! I bet you were relieved!	hit:254_conv:508_2_99
I was, it saved me a lot of problems	hit:254_conv:508_3_111
I bet, losing your phone causes all kinds of stress!	hit:254_conv:508_4_99
I written down my notes on a double sided A4 paper, now I just have to wait for the exam which will begin in the next 5 minutes.	hit:255_conv:510_1_101
Okay that's good to know. Hopefully you pass the test and I hope you studied. 	hit:255_conv:510_2_109
Oh I did, I have been doing it for weeks!	hit:255_conv:510_3_101
Very nice man. Let me know your exam results when they're released! 	hit:255_conv:510_4_109
An employee who had not been working as long as me received a promotion	hit:257_conv:515_1_111
Oh no! I'll bet that made you feel terrible!	hit:257_conv:515_2_72
I definitely did not feel appreciated	hit:257_conv:515_3_111
I can see why not! I'm so sorry that happened to you.	hit:257_conv:515_4_72
When that happened to me, even the teacher couldn't stop herself from laughing. 	hit:258_conv:517_1_108
That is hilarious. I bet.	hit:258_conv:517_2_14
I was so awkward and quiet in school, how about yourself?	hit:258_conv:517_3_108
Oh my just the opposite LOL	hit:258_conv:517_4_14
So you were outgoing and popular, huh?	hit:258_conv:517_5_108
I can't wait to December when my first born arrives into the world. I'm going to make sure they have a great life.	hit:263_conv:526_1_60
Oh wow! Congratulations! That is wonderful.	hit:263_conv:526_2_99
Thanks I'm stressed, excited and hopeful for the future. Do you have kids?	hit:263_conv:526_3_60
I do not yet but hope to one day. I think you will be a great parent! 	hit:263_conv:526_4_99
Thank you. We have been trying for a year. 	hit:263_conv:526_5_60
I was just speaking with my buddy. He is very over wight and somehow finished a marathon last weekend. Impressive!	hit:266_conv:532_1_60
wow yes it is 	hit:266_conv:532_2_14
I couldn't believe it. Just the day before we were crushing cheese steaks.	hit:266_conv:532_3_60
He probably stored that up for his energy for the race	hit:266_conv:532_4_14
I guess, I;m sure he eat again after that. He loves food. If he can do it I know I can run one.	hit:266_conv:532_5_60
My friend stayed awake for 36 hours studying for the MCAT! 	hit:267_conv:535_1_79
Haha oh wow, how was that for them	hit:267_conv:535_2_42
she did well actually, i was impressed with how well she managed to do despite lack of sleep!	hit:267_conv:535_3_79
Thats great, im glad she did well	hit:267_conv:535_4_42
I was commuting to work and a driver cut me off	hit:268_conv:537_1_111
I hate it when that happens! were you ok?	hit:268_conv:537_2_68
I made it out ok, just so irritating	hit:268_conv:537_3_111
I always wonder what goes through peoples heads when that happens.	hit:268_conv:537_4_68
I was busy due to work and visited my family for the first time in awhile	hit:269_conv:539_1_111
That sounds nice! DId you have fun	hit:269_conv:539_2_99
It was great, felt refreshing to be around them	hit:269_conv:539_3_111
I'm glad you enjoyed yourself, it is important to make time for family.	hit:269_conv:539_4_99
I get so annoyed with people who say one thing and do something else. My boss is one of those people. I wish there was just instance that I could be like this is where he annoyed me, but that isn't the case. It happens every day. 	hit:270_conv:540_1_8
I'm sorry to hear you're having to deal with that	hit:270_conv:540_2_99
Yeah, it can get annoying at times. I just stir clear of him when he is around. 	hit:270_conv:540_3_8
Sounds like the best thing to do honestly	hit:270_conv:540_4_99
I have an 8 hour shift in the office today but i can't wait to go home to see my boyfriend! 	hit:271_conv:542_1_79
you will survive, and you have something to look forward to	hit:271_conv:542_2_42
exactly, it's keeping me going since i'm not feeling to good today!	hit:271_conv:542_3_79
i hope your work day goes by fast	hit:271_conv:542_4_42
When I was 12, I got ran over by a truck. I was with my older cousin and his car messed up. Since he was my hero, I listened to everything he said, so when he told me to get the truck rolling and jump in. I listened. however, my 12 year old legs didn't make it and got trapped under the truck	hit:272_conv:544_1_8
Oh wow that is so scary.  I can't believe he asked someone so young to do that.	hit:272_conv:544_2_103
"Well, he was 17 at the time, so in his defense, he just was being a ""dumb teenager"". My parents never let me go with him again after that though. "	hit:272_conv:544_3_8
I really hope you didn't have any lasting effects from the injury?	hit:272_conv:544_4_103
I only got a B- on an assignment i worked really hard on recently, but i'm working even harder now studying to ace the exam! 	hit:275_conv:550_1_79
Wow! I'm sorry to hear that. Do you think you will get an A this time?	hit:275_conv:550_2_117
 I do actually! 	hit:275_conv:550_3_79
Congratulations! Studying can be hard, but sometimes it's about technique rather than time spent. Are you doing anything different this time?	hit:275_conv:550_4_117
I was inspecting rooms yesterday when I bent down to look under a bed, I felt the back of my pants tear. The hole was the entire back of my pants. 	hit:276_conv:552_1_60
Oh no! I'm so sorry! I hate when that happens!	hit:276_conv:552_2_104
Yes, I have a staff of 30 and I think each one saw me at some point in the day. I have Khaki's on. I had to tape and staple the hole. 	hit:276_conv:552_3_60
Ugh! That's the worst! Too bad you couldn't run home and change!	hit:276_conv:552_4_104
That would have been nice. But home is an hour each way. 	hit:276_conv:552_5_60
I had to compose myself and pull over to remove the spider. I'm so thankful that I didn't freak out and crash the car.	hit:278_conv:557_1_108
Oh that sounds so scary!	hit:278_conv:557_2_99
It was very scary, i'm terrified of spiders. What are you afraid of?	hit:278_conv:557_3_108
I hate snakes! They are like little evil creatures.	hit:278_conv:557_4_99
So as I've gotten older over the last 10 years. I gained 30 pounds. My wife has me on a diet but every night when she goes to bed I have a bowl of ice cream. 	hit:279_conv:559_1_60
Don't even tlak about diets.I miss the times i was young and could eat all i wanted	hit:279_conv:559_2_75
yea but those times are behind us. Tonight for dinner was a Kale salad. It was gross but I've gotten a dish or rocky road with my name on it later. I do feel bad for lying to her but I need it.	hit:279_conv:559_3_60
Ugh.So boring.What wrong with being fat.At least they are all happy.	hit:279_conv:559_4_75
"I think I'm average. I'm 5'11"" 190. It could be worse. I still exercise a lot. Perhaps I need to enjoy the ice cream more and try to feel less guilty.  "	hit:279_conv:559_5_60
Did you ever attend college? I just completed my bachelor's degree and I'm feeling really good about my future!	hit:280_conv:560_1_79

Have you ever felt sandpaper on your bottom? Because that is what the new recycled toilet paper my wife want's us to use feels like. 	hit:282_conv:565_1_60
Holy smokes! Let me guess, better for the environment?	hit:282_conv:565_2_117
yes but in the end it's still paper and still going to the same place. I dream of the day I can enjoy Angel Soft or Charmin again.	hit:282_conv:565_3_60
You poor soul! I'm all for saving the planet, but you have to draw the line somewhere. I hope you get some relief!	hit:282_conv:565_4_117
I'm going to have to start waiting until I go to work to use the potty.	hit:282_conv:565_5_60
I scored a 95 on my promotion exam, I was upset that I missed one question.	hit:285_conv:571_1_108
But that is an awesome grade!  You should be so proud!!!	hit:285_conv:571_2_56
Thank you, I am definitely proud! When was your last exam?	hit:285_conv:571_3_108
Oh, it's been years since I've taken an exam!  Perhaps the last one was a para-pro exam to help out in the local schools when my kids were younger - but they didn't even give me the grade - it was a pass/fail type exam (the horror of not knowing the grade though!!)	hit:285_conv:571_4_56
On the way from work I hit 155 in my VW on the Autobahn. I was well impressed with the car.	hit:288_conv:577_1_60

Awesome, it's time to buy another.	hit:288_conv:577_5_60
Last weekend I did something big. I finished my first 125 mile Iron man race. I'm still pumped.	hit:289_conv:579_1_60
I have never done that, good job.	hit:289_conv:579_2_4
That's it was a bucket list item and the hardest thing I have ever done but now I want to do it again.	hit:289_conv:579_3_60
You should. When is the next one.	hit:289_conv:579_4_4
This fall. I'm need to train more. It was a 26 mile running race, 10 mile swim and the rest on bikes. So much fun!	hit:289_conv:579_5_60
Last night I was looking at my things I have in a storage locker and found a tub filled with my grandfathers things. The good memories came flooding back.	hit:290_conv:581_1_60
Oh wow thats cool.	hit:290_conv:581_2_4
Yes, he's been gone 10 years but I still think of him daily. It's strange how someone can make such an impact on someone for so long. 	hit:290_conv:581_3_60
Thats good you still think of him.	hit:290_conv:581_4_4
Yes, he was my hero and still is I guess. 	hit:290_conv:581_5_60
I went to a school for massage therapy, but I was worried at first that it would be strange to massage people I didn't know. 	hit:293_conv:587_1_61
Thats cool. Was it hard?	hit:293_conv:587_2_4
Some of it was. I had to learn the name, attachment point, and action of every muscle in the body. There are over 800. 	hit:293_conv:587_3_61
Wow that is a lot.	hit:293_conv:587_4_4
I think I get it from my mom. She would never open the door for uninvited guests.	hit:297_conv:595_1_108
What do you get from your mom?	hit:297_conv:595_2_99
Being bothered by uninvited guests	hit:297_conv:595_3_108
I don't like uninvited guests either! So annoying!	hit:297_conv:595_4_99
Some people think it's ridiculous to have a problem with that, but I adore my privacy and space.	hit:297_conv:595_5_108
My first dog was a dalmatian. We adopted her and then went right to a soccer game before I even had time to play with her. 	hit:299_conv:598_1_61
I love dalmatians.	hit:299_conv:598_2_4
She was a great dog! That game felt so so long though. I had to watch her sitting with my parents while I played. 	hit:299_conv:598_3_61
How old was she.	hit:299_conv:598_4_4
6 weeks when we got her. 	hit:299_conv:598_5_61
I have a friend who is always complaining. She always has to make it sound like her life is harder than everyone else's. 	hit:304_conv:608_1_61
Well maybe it is but it could also just be she's spoiled.	hit:304_conv:608_2_68
I didn't know her when she was young, so she could be. I think she just likes to be miserable. 	hit:304_conv:608_3_61
Does she have like some other issues like mentally?	hit:304_conv:608_4_68
I wouldn't be surprised. 	hit:304_conv:608_5_61
Have you ever put a pair of shoes on your feet that felt so sweet that made your sole happy?	hit:309_conv:618_1_60
I have a pair of fuzzy slippers that make me feel pretty cozy and happy in.	hit:309_conv:618_2_121
yea, I had that but recently my shoes wore out and they no longer make them. I'm so sad!	hit:309_conv:618_3_60
That is the worse, you finally find a brand and fit that perfect and they discontinue making them that is the worst, happens to me all the time.	hit:309_conv:618_4_121
Yes, I was angry and sad.	hit:309_conv:618_5_60
So did you end up finding a shoe that you could live with and that was close to the ones you had, or have you been unsuccessful?	hit:309_conv:618_6_121
nope, I gave up on shoes all together. 	hit:309_conv:618_7_60
I was on lunch and my coworker made me laugh. I pee'ed my self. I felt like I wanted to die.	hit:313_conv:627_1_60
Wow, did they notice?	hit:313_conv:627_2_4
yep, to make it worse I'm the boss. I'm pregnant so I tried to pass it off like the baby was pressing on my bladder. 	hit:313_conv:627_3_60
They will forget about it soon.	hit:313_conv:627_4_4
The next day someone had put a diaper in my desk.	hit:313_conv:627_5_60
Becasue of a certain person who worked at the corner grocery I became uneasy to shop there.	hit:316_conv:632_1_122
I am so sorry to hear that. What did they do to make you feel uncomfortable going there?	hit:316_conv:632_2_117
They were a friend and customer of mine in a small business and cheated me out of a large sum of money.	hit:316_conv:632_3_122
That's the worst! You think you can trust people, and then they stab you in the back. I don't blame you for not wanting to see them again.	hit:316_conv:632_4_117
I just found out my new insurance is going to cover my big dental surgery coming up. No more bad jibbers!	hit:317_conv:635_1_60
That is great. That should be good insurance. Are you generaly happy with it?	hit:317_conv:635_2_7
Yes, they are covering $4,500 worth of work. I only have to pay $100 total. I can't wait to have good teeth. 	hit:317_conv:635_3_60
That is nice. Good luck with the sugery.	hit:317_conv:635_4_7
Thanks, I'm a little scared but it will be worth it. Being from the UK bad teeth are in my genes.	hit:317_conv:635_5_60
I have a solo trip coming up. I'm going to Colorado to climb Mt. Elbert Solo. It's the tallest mountain in the united states.	hit:321_conv:643_1_60
I love Colorado, my favorite state.	hit:321_conv:643_2_4
Yes me two. I used to live in Colorado. I have not been up a mountain that big in years, I'm getting the belly butterfly's. 	hit:321_conv:643_3_60
I wish I could live there.	hit:321_conv:643_4_4
It was a great place to live but very expensive and winter was rough.	hit:321_conv:643_5_60
Last weekend I was on a date with a wonderful guy but right after dinner I got bad gas.	hit:322_conv:645_1_60
Did you fart?	hit:322_conv:645_2_4
It sounded like trumpets were filling the room. He looked like he wanted to puke each and ever time. 	hit:322_conv:645_3_60
Did they smell?	hit:322_conv:645_4_4
Have you ever drove past a cow farm or garage dump? Yes, well those smell better then I did that night. 	hit:322_conv:645_5_60
We had a hail storm about a month ago. It ruined our roof so we are trying to find a good roofing company to replace it. 	hit:324_conv:649_1_61
Did anyone get hurt?	hit:324_conv:649_2_4
No, thank goodness. Just a lot of car and property damage in the area. 	hit:324_conv:649_3_61
Thats good, as long as no one got hurt.	hit:324_conv:649_4_4
My husband just ran a Marathon. He had no training I was blown away by him. True inspiration! 	hit:327_conv:655_1_60
No training at all!  Wow, that's pretty impressive.  How far is a marathon?	hit:327_conv:655_2_56
26.2 miles. He walks about 10 miles a day at work so that's some training sorta.	hit:327_conv:655_3_60
That's still pretty impressive.  I bet he was proud of himself also!  Does he plan to do it again and will you maybe do it with him?	hit:327_conv:655_4_56
He wants to do an Iron Man. 126.2 miles, running, biking and swimming.	hit:327_conv:655_5_60
WOW - he certainly is adventurous and determined.  I bet he will do amazing.	hit:327_conv:655_6_56
Yes, I'm well impressed with him. 	hit:327_conv:655_7_60
I don't like saying this, and this is the first time I have but a few days ago I drove by my ex-wife and mine house, and for a few seconds it made me nostalgic. 	hit:329_conv:659_1_8
Wow you are brave.	hit:329_conv:659_2_4
Yes, it was only a fleeting moment but it was there. 	hit:329_conv:659_3_8
I bet you drove fast.	hit:329_conv:659_4_4
I'm going skydiving this weekend. I'm afraid of heights and freaking out a little.	hit:330_conv:660_1_60
Oh my! That sounds exciting for sure! I couldn't do it, I don't think.	hit:330_conv:660_2_108
Yea, until this morning when I called and put down a deposit I did not think I could either.	hit:330_conv:660_3_60
Have you ever done anything else so frightening?	hit:330_conv:660_4_108
Yes, I love doing something crazy and the feeling I get from it. 	hit:330_conv:660_5_60
I would say that you're an adventurous person. Me, I'm more laid back and mellow. Kudos to you and have fun!	hit:330_conv:660_6_108
That's i'm so scared but it will be worth it. You only have one life so don't hold back.	hit:330_conv:660_7_60
Can you believe that I learned to ride a bike at age 15?	hit:330_conv:661_1_108
At least you did it. Lance Armstrong did not learn until he was 13.	hit:330_conv:661_2_60
Really? I didn't know that. Is there anything that you'd say you were a late bloomer for?	hit:330_conv:661_3_108
Love, it took me 12 years with the same person to build up the courage to ask her to marry me. 	hit:330_conv:661_4_60
Well congratulations for taking your time, look at it that way.	hit:330_conv:661_5_108
yes not if I can just calm the nerves for this skydiving trip.	hit:330_conv:661_6_60
Maybe try controlled breathing exercises, I'm sure you'll be fine and want to do it again.	hit:330_conv:661_7_108
Hope so. I don't do well with heights.	hit:330_conv:661_8_60
I had a huge exam that like 25 percent of my grade. I study for 2 weeks for it	hit:331_conv:663_1_8
Oh, I bet that was very stressful and difficult. I hope you did well on it?	hit:331_conv:663_2_45
Yeah because the professor got mad that the book store didn't have the little blue books to write in, so he canceled it and said whatever our current grade was to bump it up a letter grade	hit:331_conv:663_3_8
Well, at least you didn't go down in your grade. But, it wasn't right to treat the students like that!	hit:331_conv:663_4_45
As i get older I've fully accepted who I am. I'm not here to impress. It makes life easier when you think like this.	hit:335_conv:671_1_60
That is good, how old are you?	hit:335_conv:671_2_4
33 so not super old or super young. Just happy with who I am.	hit:335_conv:671_3_60
I am 31 so same generation.	hit:335_conv:671_4_4
Have you stopped caring yet? About others opinions? 	hit:335_conv:671_5_60
Got a pizza last night. It gave me food poison. Now I'm stilling here sick and angry.	hit:340_conv:680_1_60
Oh gosh, I am sorry. Did you let the pizza place know? 	hit:340_conv:680_2_8
Yes, I called and they laughed at me. Told me it was the new pizza buy and that he must have used old cheese or something. 	hit:340_conv:680_3_60
Wow! In that instance, I would prefer them to lie to me than to laugh and be like I knowingly fed you bad food. 	hit:340_conv:680_4_8
Yes, for the first 12 hours I just had to lay in the bathroom floor in pain.	hit:340_conv:680_5_60
I had studied for an exam for several days, so I was confident when I strolled into class because I knew I would ace it	hit:340_conv:681_1_8
and did you knock it out of the park? 	hit:340_conv:681_2_60
Uh, I made a B on it,  so it was a false sense of confidence, lol	hit:340_conv:681_3_8
Perhaps be less cocky next time? Either way B's get degree's. 	hit:340_conv:681_4_60
When my son was 5 years old, he had to have his tonsils taken out. I thought it would be nothing, but when they went to take him back, I got so anxious. 	hit:341_conv:682_1_8
Was he okay? I've never heard of that going wrong.	hit:341_conv:682_2_27
Yeah, he was fine, but I had read a few horror stories online. I knew I shouldn't, but I did. 	hit:341_conv:682_3_8
That's where you went wrong lol. I'm glad he was fine. I would've been scared if it were one of my kids too. Surgery is still surgery.	hit:341_conv:682_4_27
My neighbors are still doing fireworks every night around midnight. Scares my dogs and they can't sleep through it. 	hit:347_conv:695_1_61
Oh, I bet that could be frightening for your dogs. Did you try to complain to them?	hit:347_conv:695_2_125
We don't know them well, but if they do it again tonight we probably will. I understand on the 4th and even a couple of days after, but some people have to get up for work. 	hit:347_conv:695_3_61
I think they have some leftover fireworks that they don't want to sit on. They should just use them next time.	hit:347_conv:695_4_125
My dog had bone cancer and we had to put her down. It was a very sad, but necessary decision. 	hit:354_conv:709_1_61
it takes a strong and compassionate person to make that kind of decision.	hit:354_conv:709_2_1
It was very hard, but she was suffering. Our vet was very helpful and we did ask him if he thought it was too soon. He assured us that it was not. 	hit:354_conv:709_3_61
She had a happy life. I'm sure she understands.	hit:354_conv:709_4_1
My mom is here visiting me and my family. It has been a really fun visit. 	hit:360_conv:721_1_61
Sounds nice. How long has it been since you've seen her?	hit:360_conv:721_2_1
About seven months. Too long. 	hit:360_conv:721_3_61
Oh wow. That is a long time. Do you live far apart?	hit:360_conv:721_4_1
Yes, about a 17 hour drive. 	hit:360_conv:721_5_61
We had a really great guest speaker at work today.	hit:374_conv:748_1_132
That's awesome! What did they talk about?	hit:374_conv:748_2_133
He was a retired FBI agent who talked about his experiences in the field in the 1970's.	hit:374_conv:748_3_132
Fascinating! What kind of work do you do?	hit:374_conv:748_4_133
I'm a role player that trains law enforcement by acting as victims or suspects.	hit:374_conv:748_5_132
Sounds like it was very exciting!	hit:374_conv:748_6_133
Yeah he talked about his toughest cases and some funny storties about suspects who incriminated themselves with simple linguistic tricks.	hit:374_conv:748_7_132
I am a bit Breaking Bad fan and love Better Call Saul. Season 4 starts in August. 	hit:390_conv:780_1_61
Me too! I also Iike staying home all day.	hit:390_conv:780_2_141
I wonder what will happen this season. I'm expecting it to be really nail biting. 	hit:390_conv:780_3_61
I have more time to watch movies and shows on netflix alot. I stay home with my little one year old during the day.	hit:390_conv:780_4_141
I came home today and someone had eaten my leftovers. I was so irritated!	hit:392_conv:784_1_108
I hate when that happens!  I look forward to those all day you know!  Did you find out who the culprit was?	hit:392_conv:784_2_56
Yes, it was my partner. He owes me big time	hit:392_conv:784_3_108
I think that calls for a nice steak dinner out - on his dime!	hit:392_conv:784_4_56
Right! He says i'm greedy anyway, but that's besides the point!	hit:392_conv:784_5_108
I got into some serious financial troubles a few years back.	hit:395_conv:790_1_122
It happens to everyone, are you out of it now?	hit:395_conv:790_2_126
yeah but what I did was terrible. I was self employed and I manipulated the system so I received money I was not owed/. My husband helped me out of the jam once I came clean about aht I did.	hit:395_conv:790_3_122
Oh well, it was nice to have someone to help you.	hit:395_conv:790_4_126
Do you like fair rides? I can't take them myself.	hit:403_conv:807_1_108
I don't like them at all. I've seen too many videos on the internet where people get injured or they break easily	hit:403_conv:807_2_0
Yes, I remember in 2007 a teen was decapitated at Six Flags in Atlanta.	hit:403_conv:807_3_108
Yeah that is terrifying. The smaller country fairs are worse. I bet they have no one really checking up on them except the carney folk.	hit:403_conv:807_4_0
I just don't think they're safe enough, many rides at the small carnivals are rickety and wobbly.	hit:403_conv:807_5_108
yeah, and the people in charge don't get paid enough to always check up and repair them	hit:403_conv:807_6_0
I'll just stick to the food and go home. Funnel Cakes and Polish Sausages are my favs.	hit:403_conv:807_7_108
Two years ago, I discovered that my now ex-wife was cheating on me with someone she worked with. When I first discovered it, i was angry and hurt.	hit:407_conv:814_1_8
I bet you were, I did that to my husband when I was young. I thought it was the solution to relief from abuse.	hit:407_conv:814_2_108
I know it was a horrible experience at the time, now I think its the greatest thing to ever happen to me. Sleeping in different beds for 3 years isn't healthy. It took that to wake me up	hit:407_conv:814_3_8
I guess that was what you call a temporary situation. Sometimes moving on is required.	hit:407_conv:814_4_108
I wish I could go back to the 80's for a little while at times. 	hit:407_conv:815_1_108
Don't you wish you knew you were living in the good ol days while your going through them	hit:407_conv:815_2_8
That's nothing but the truth! What's your favorite era?	hit:407_conv:815_3_108
Don't you wish you knew you were living in the good ol days while your going through them	hit:407_conv:815_4_8
Do you have a favorite era?	hit:407_conv:815_5_108
Probably the mid to late 90s. This is going to be hilarious but my one memory from that era is when I first heard Brittany Spears hit me baby one more time song. It changed my life	hit:407_conv:815_6_8
Did you graduate high school? It's a lot harder than most people think.	hit:411_conv:823_1_147
Sure I did! It takes determation to succeed	hit:411_conv:823_2_25
I didn't think I woudl have to do that much studying. I figured that came later in college. 	hit:411_conv:823_3_147
So if not by studying ,what else?	hit:411_conv:823_4_25
I hit my toe on the edge of the doorway and it bent backwards. I was furious and crying at the same time!	hit:412_conv:824_1_108
That must have hurt a lot.Did you go to the hospital? 	hit:412_conv:824_2_75
No, I don't have insurance. Just like when I twisted my ankle on the stairs and fell. It took months to heal, but it healed.	hit:412_conv:824_3_108
You are very accident prone.You should get an insurance right away.	hit:412_conv:824_4_75
That's hilarious! I can't afford it right now though. I'll just be more careful.	hit:412_conv:824_5_108
Sometimes we can get a phone call that shakes us to the core.	hit:415_conv:830_1_122
That is so true. And sometimes that phone call can be a trip of a life time!	hit:415_conv:830_2_147
My phone call was my mom telling me my 32 year old had just died of a heart attack while at her house.	hit:415_conv:830_3_122
Oh my goodness! Once things settle down I will give you the info about our cruise. It will help you relax like it did me!	hit:415_conv:830_4_147
I can't believe my husband planned this all by himself! My mind is still blown by this!	hit:415_conv:831_1_147
Sounds so exciting. What did he plan?	hit:415_conv:831_2_122
We are going to Mexico. I have mixed feelings, but mostly excited!	hit:415_conv:831_3_147
When and how? Are you flying or driving? Just because or is it your anniversary?	hit:415_conv:831_4_122
It's our 10th anniversary. We are making the drive to FL since we live in Georgia. 	hit:415_conv:831_5_147
Don't you hate when you have to give stuff away and then can't? Well, that happened to me recently. I was going to give away some of my son's old toys, but started looking at then and realized that I need to keep them for no other reason than that I was being sentimental 	hit:416_conv:832_1_8
That's too funny. You know, I'm the exact same way.. I get so nostalgic with my old things. Can never throw them away!	hit:416_conv:832_2_146
I know! I am always like I need this notebook that has my 3rd grade handwriting back from the 90s because it will be very useful someday... lol	hit:416_conv:832_3_8
Yes, someday... Haha. I love looking back at those kinds of things. It brings back so many good memories. Such a good feeling	hit:416_conv:832_4_146
I was looking through some of my old pictures a week or so ago, and saw a picture of my grandmother who passed away a few years ago	hit:422_conv:844_1_8
I'm sorry to hear that. Were you two very close?	hit:422_conv:844_2_152
Yes, we were. I used to spend my summer vacations with her when my parents were out of town, so it allowed me to get really close with her.	hit:422_conv:844_3_8
That's sweet, I had the same experience with my own grandma too. God bless y'all!	hit:422_conv:844_4_152
I was frozen in fear at the gym Monday, when a guy started seizing. He got so violent and ran away from paramedics.	hit:423_conv:847_1_108
Wow, that must have been challenging for everyone! Was he okay ultimately? Was someone able to help him?	hit:423_conv:847_2_66
They couldn't capture him, he jumped the fence by the pool and rolled down a hill. I don't know what happened to him.	hit:423_conv:847_3_108
That IS frightening! Hopefully nothing you'll have to deal with again!	hit:423_conv:847_4_66
I hope not! I'm not good with crisis situations at all!	hit:423_conv:847_5_108
Yes, I was surprise on how he changed to another talk	hit:424_conv:849_1_153
What was the initial talk?	hit:424_conv:849_2_25
I should descript how I could feel when am lonely	hit:424_conv:849_3_153
So how do you feel when lonely?	hit:424_conv:849_4_25
Wow, the situation is always very bad	hit:424_conv:849_5_153
It is funny how you can be going through life thinking everything is great, and then one day you find a nude of another dude that isn't you on your wife's computer. Makes for a wonderful day!	hit:426_conv:852_1_8
Maybe she does not have the hots for you anymore.	hit:426_conv:852_2_75
It is funny how you can be going through life thinking everything is great, and then one day you find a nude of another dude that isn't you on your wife's computer. Makes for a wonderful day!	hit:426_conv:852_3_8
yes, i understood the first time.	hit:426_conv:852_4_75
Oh, sorry, I meant to say Ex-wife. I am so glad she didn't. The years haven't be kind to her, so got out just at the right time, lol	hit:426_conv:852_5_8
I slipped on a puddle in the mall once. I was so embarrassed that I pretended I was hurt badly.	hit:427_conv:855_1_108
I know the feeling. Once I fell in high school from a puddle and laughed it off even though I was hurt,	hit:427_conv:855_2_151
Even animals get embarrassed, I've seen it in my cats.	hit:427_conv:855_3_108
Oh really? I haven't seen that in an animal as of yet. That's pretty interesting.	hit:427_conv:855_4_151
Yes, my cat fell from the mantle above the fireplace and looked totally embarrassed.	hit:427_conv:855_5_108
Oh dang, talk about a fall! If I were your cat I'd be embarrassed too! Lol	hit:427_conv:855_6_151
One day my girlfriend told me about a guy that works with her and she mentioned how hilarious he was which then made me think of a meme that i read about how funny guys will make you laugh and then all of a sudden you don't have clothes on. It was only for a split second but it happened	hit:430_conv:860_1_8
That is a hilarious intro, thank you for that! So were you worried that your girlfriend found someone else humorous? (And you're very insightful + intelligent if you say yes! Though being both of those things, you have nothing to worry about ;-))	hit:430_conv:860_2_66
"Well, I most def want to be insightful and intelligent, so I will say YES. I know I had nothing to worry about, but it is crazy how in those instances when you least expect it a ridiculous meme shots into your brain and you start playing ""Along Came Polly"" sceneros in your head. "	hit:430_conv:860_3_8
These references are perfect. And your girlfriend must enjoy you very much. Mazel tov, you crazy kids!	hit:430_conv:860_4_66
Lately, my two year old boy has been so much into wearing dresses and playing with babie dolls,i don't even want to think of i	hit:431_conv:862_1_6
Is that good or bad? Why the concern?	hit:431_conv:862_2_25
I think it is bad	hit:431_conv:862_3_6
OK why do you think so?	hit:431_conv:862_4_25
Boys are meant to be playing with car toys not dolls.	hit:431_conv:862_5_6
It is such a privilege to be able to help someone in any way you can.	hit:433_conv:866_1_108
Indeed. It makes you feel good when you can help somebody else with their problem	hit:433_conv:866_2_155
It also makes me feel bad when i'm unable to help.	hit:433_conv:866_3_108
I think if everybody in the world offered a hand of help to one another, we would not have much problem	hit:433_conv:866_4_155
That is so true! There is no reason for there to be a problem with famine in the world.	hit:433_conv:866_5_108
My math teacher told the class I needed to do better on my next test.	hit:439_conv:879_1_158
Well you should try to study more and see what happens	hit:439_conv:879_2_46
I did, I can't remember, I either made an A or a B in there.	hit:439_conv:879_3_158
Well maybe you should talk about getting a tutor or somethinf	hit:439_conv:879_4_46
Well, this isn't going to make me sound like the manliest individual ever, but I think I need to tell it to someone. A few weeks ago, I was driving home from work. It was late. i was tired. So I wasn't my usual self. I was singing along to some song when all of a sudden I glanced up and saw two eyes looking back at me, and at the time I didn't know whos eyes they were so I was scared to death. I slammed on my breaks, in the middle of the road, jumped out, and was ready to run... I mean fight whoever was in my back seat. Long story short, I saw my own reflection in the mirror. 	hit:441_conv:883_1_8
THAT IS TERRIFYING. Until the end of your story.. then I laughed so hard I cried. But that is so relatable. I've been terrified of my own shadow more than once.	hit:441_conv:883_2_140
It seems to happen to me at least once a week. If I watch a scary movie or show then it happens at least every other day until I forget about it, lol	hit:441_conv:883_3_8
That's hilarious, But I also feel bad for you. Perhaps there is a way to calm yourself down after you watch a scary movie?	hit:441_conv:883_4_140
I have gotten better. I don't have to sleep in my parents bed anymore. Granted, I am 32 now, lol	hit:441_conv:883_5_8
Haha hey I would sneak into my parents bed even as a teenager when I was scared, especially during storms.	hit:441_conv:883_6_140
Why no response?	hit:444_conv:888_1_153
I'm supposed to wait for you to start. :) 	hit:444_conv:888_2_154
Is my response not good enough?	hit:444_conv:888_3_153
You haven't said anything yet other than asking why I hadn't responded. Sorry I'm a little lost as to what I was supposed to respond to?	hit:444_conv:888_4_154
Se	hit:444_conv:888_5_153
It is really hot here most of the year.	hit:446_conv:893_1_158
Really?  Where do you live at?	hit:446_conv:893_2_160
Alabama. It's winter for about 2 weeks.	hit:446_conv:893_3_158
I feel your pain.  I live in Orlando, Florida.  So Im in the same boat.	hit:446_conv:893_4_160
Ok I was in Walmart buying a video game when this dud eshows up and immediately questions my selection. Like it's some kind of internet forum!	hit:447_conv:895_1_132
That is so annoying.Who he thinks he is???	hit:447_conv:895_2_75
"I dunno, but I just said ""That's great, bro"" and left.  Then he follows me to the checkout counter to continue giving me crap about it."	hit:447_conv:895_3_132
I would be scared of a guy like that.	hit:447_conv:895_4_75
Well I just got incensed with him and told the clerk to do something about him or I'm not shopping there anymore.  He was told to leave.	hit:447_conv:895_5_132
This was several years back. I was single, but I also like watching The Notebook type of movie, so i thought it would be okay to go watch The Vow alone. Wrong! Horrible mistake. It was a tear jerker, and I had no one there to see it and be like awe. All those tears wasted for nothing! lol	hit:449_conv:899_1_8
Aww... sorry to hear that. I haven't personally seen the show. What hit you the most?	hit:449_conv:899_2_162
Oh, it was a movie about a woman who lost her memory, and her husband had to get her to fall back in love with him. At the time, I was like I want that; however, now that I am in a relationship, I am like I don't know about this. I wish she would get amnesia as well	hit:449_conv:899_3_8
Sounds like a touching but sad story. Love without two ways interaction is really hard. I can't imagine myself going through relationship like this honestly..	hit:449_conv:899_4_162
I was joyful because my grandad shared the gospel with me when I was 11.	hit:455_conv:910_1_158
You mean nostalgic?	hit:455_conv:910_2_75
I guess I am nostalgic now.	hit:455_conv:910_3_158
What your grand father did to you was very special.	hit:455_conv:910_4_75
He read a tract to me. He explained God's love for me with pictures in a way I could understand.	hit:455_conv:910_5_158
Can you believe that my neighbors downstairs allow their dog to relieve itself in the street?	hit:456_conv:913_1_108
That is not very considerate or respectful, plus the dog could get hurt if a vehicle were traveling down the street.	hit:456_conv:913_2_163
That's what i'm afraid of as well! But the dog seems to only want to use it that way. Do you like your neighbors?	hit:456_conv:913_3_108
I live in the country, so I do not have neighbors that live close. 	hit:456_conv:913_4_163
How fortunate, my grandparents lived in the country. I would always be scared at night thinking of their scary stories. 	hit:456_conv:913_5_108
I sometimes get freaked out, but getting freaked out every now and then is better than having to deal with neighbors. 	hit:456_conv:913_6_163
That's true. You can live in peace.	hit:456_conv:913_7_108
Yes. Peace is key.	hit:456_conv:913_8_163
I regret drinking way too much soda. Now my teeth look bad.	hit:460_conv:921_1_158
Uhmmnn! Cut down on the intake 	hit:460_conv:921_2_25
I quit. Probably going to need some fillings.	hit:460_conv:921_3_158
You need to see a dentist then	hit:460_conv:921_4_25
Have you ever felt really annoyed at yourself?	hit:461_conv:922_1_165
Just all the time.Who does not?	hit:461_conv:922_2_75
Yeah right now I dont know how to make a game install on another drive. Do you?	hit:461_conv:922_3_165
It depends on the machine you are working on.	hit:461_conv:922_4_75
This is a silly story, but it reminds me how confident teenagers can be. When I got my first tattoo, for some reason, it gave me this false sense of confidence. I am not sure why other than at the time I thought my tribal tattoo was something to admire	hit:462_conv:925_1_8
Do you have a tribal tattoo. How does it look like?	hit:462_conv:925_2_166
I got it when I was 18. I didn't take care of it, so now it looks like a shady prison tattoo, lol	hit:462_conv:925_3_8
That was bad. You can try some tattoo removal tool	hit:462_conv:925_4_166
A co-worker at work needed some money for a drink, but I didnt have any cash, so I let them have my debit card to go buy them something	hit:465_conv:931_1_8
Did you know them well? You must be very trusting.	hit:465_conv:931_2_145
A co-worker at work needed some money for a drink, but I didnt have any cash, so I let them have my debit card to go buy them something	hit:465_conv:931_3_8
I think I would have just said I didn't have any cash and let that be the end of it.	hit:465_conv:931_4_145
Not really. The individual kind of seemed shady as well, but my debit card has a feature that allows me to turn it off	hit:465_conv:931_5_8
I never expected to fail my final exams,that is a major blow for me.	hit:466_conv:933_1_6
Sorry! Try harder next time!	hit:466_conv:933_2_25
Yeah, i know,i ought to have taken my studies seriously.	hit:466_conv:933_3_6
Never late you know!	hit:466_conv:933_4_25
Am surprised there is no response from my friend.	hit:467_conv:934_1_153
That sucks. Are they mad or what?	hit:467_conv:934_2_158
Sucks? I don't know about sucks.	hit:467_conv:934_3_153
It's kinda annoying to me when people don't call you back.	hit:467_conv:934_4_158
I was scared when I was in a wreck.	hit:467_conv:935_1_158
Serious? Why are you scared when you are in a wreck?	hit:467_conv:935_2_153
I was on an overpass and didn't want to fall off.	hit:467_conv:935_3_158
Wow, you really have to be careful dear.	hit:467_conv:935_4_153
Have you ever felt really ashamed?	hit:470_conv:940_1_165
Yes I have, it feels really bad when it happens.	hit:470_conv:940_2_63
Yeah same. Sometimes I can make a fool of myself by trying to act too smart or something like that.	hit:470_conv:940_3_165
Yea it can be quite embarrassing to look back on.	hit:470_conv:940_4_63
My younger brother always get the best dates and beautiful girls to date,i hate it.	hit:472_conv:944_1_6
Come on, you do not have to be jealous of your brother	hit:472_conv:944_2_166
I can't handle that very well. I need to get my groove and swag on. Damn it!	hit:472_conv:944_3_6
You can learnt some skills from your brother. Maybe it will help	hit:472_conv:944_4_166
It's high time i get my self a girlfriend,i feel so bored up	hit:479_conv:959_1_6
Are you trying to go out and meet some ladies 	hit:479_conv:959_2_166
Yeah, i'm so ready to date.I want to meet my person.	hit:479_conv:959_3_6
That is the first step. What you have to do next is be at your best behavior always 	hit:479_conv:959_4_166
I really feel like depressed sometimes when I realize how bad my tech skills are.	hit:480_conv:961_1_165
Do you work in the tech industry? You could always take a class.	hit:480_conv:961_2_145
That's true. There's a lot of stuff online. No I'm completing college for a natural sciences degree lol.	hit:480_conv:961_3_165
There's ton's online, and knowing more about computers can really help any profession.	hit:480_conv:961_4_145
I don't like it when people talk with their mouth full of food	hit:485_conv:971_1_6
I am sure it is something disgusting. Do you have someone do it around you	hit:485_conv:971_2_166
Yeah, i close friend of mine likes doing that. she has to stop.	hit:485_conv:971_3_6
You can just let him know you are not comfortable with it	hit:485_conv:971_4_166
I saw an article of someone I went to high school with who was working with an Ebola patient?	hit:486_conv:973_1_158
yes the patient is very ill	hit:486_conv:973_2_172
It was cool cause her dad died of cancer, so now she is helping sick people.	hit:486_conv:973_3_158

Yes, you never know I was talking to a co-worker today and she won $2500 last year at this time 	hit:487_conv:974_5_173
I have never been ready like this for an exam in my entire life.	hit:490_conv:980_1_6
I know how you feel, I get so scared when exams come up, its so hard sometimes	hit:490_conv:980_2_63
Open book exams can be tricky, i have no option but to pass this exam.	hit:490_conv:980_3_6
Yea open book make you think you dont need to study but that isnt true at all	hit:490_conv:980_4_63

yea it was really tough but i finally did it. 4 years strong lol 	hit:491_conv:982_5_175
I was impressed because my boss has 2000 investment clients. That seems like so much work.	hit:491_conv:983_1_158
yea that does seem like a lot of work could you ever handle it?	hit:491_conv:983_2_175
Maybe. Some of them he got from a guy who retired though.	hit:491_conv:983_3_158
ooo well that explains a lot. well hopefully he will pass some to you 	hit:491_conv:983_4_175
I felt really elated to be getting work done. It's hard sometimes and  I pulled through. The happiness is real too!	hit:493_conv:986_1_165
Which work are you talking about. it is always a good feeling to get things done. There a way your brain reward you with good feeling 	hit:493_conv:986_2_166
It was just some stuff for a new job. Do you feel happy to complete stuff?	hit:493_conv:986_3_165
Oh yes, i do most times. Who does not	hit:493_conv:986_4_166
I am trying to decide where I should go next on vacation, I love travelling.	hit:494_conv:989_1_173
I say think of all the places you always wanted to go and then choose a place you never even considered.	hit:494_conv:989_2_167
That is interesting but I usually look for deals so I can go to more places	hit:494_conv:989_3_173
Yes deals will allow you to travel more for sure.	hit:494_conv:989_4_167
Yes, they also do take me to places I wouldn't think of going until I see the deal 	hit:494_conv:989_5_173
today i saw the lottery was for 36 million at the gas station so I decided to buy a ticket.	hit:499_conv:999_1_175
Do you think you can win the lottery 	hit:499_conv:999_2_166
hahaha no I don't at all but I was just really hoping that it would happen on the off chance.	hit:499_conv:999_3_175
Then why do you want to risk your money on such thing. Why not buy yourself a nice shoe instead 	hit:499_conv:999_4_166
well thats very true I guess since the ticket is only 2 bucks I figure what the heck 	hit:499_conv:999_5_175
I'm happy with where i am with life right now. Work is great, family is good and business is booming.	hit:501_conv:1002_1_6

That sounds terrible. Why didn't he come?	hit:506_conv:1013_2_165
he said he was held up at work and coud not make it	hit:506_conv:1013_3_178
Ah I see. I don't really talk to my brother much.	hit:506_conv:1013_4_165

I am relaxed right now ate a nice dinner now I am relaxing on the couch watching tv. 	hit:507_conv:1014_1_173

Im glad it turned out well or i hope so.	hit:516_conv:1032_4_63

As it should.  However those things happen to everyone it is a part of life.	hit:517_conv:1035_2_160
As sad as it may sound,that is the reality which we cant escape.	hit:517_conv:1035_3_6

I felt pretty frustrated at some tech problems I had earlier. I couldn't find a way to download a game to a different drive.	hit:520_conv:1041_1_165
I understand. I remember when we had to save games to 5 inch floppy disks. They made really strange shuffling sounds and a lot of times didn't even read.	hit:520_conv:1041_2_139
Those are old from what I understand. This was a while ago?	hit:520_conv:1041_3_165
Yeah, I had my Commodore 64 and Amiga in the late 80's. Still, the games were great when they worked!	hit:520_conv:1041_4_139
me and my kids picked  up our new puppy the other day !	hit:521_conv:1043_1_175

Go shopping and eat, I love food and Vegas has some amazing food. 	hit:524_conv:1048_3_173
I've been one time but I was too young to drink or gamble so it was a little boring. That sounds like a great time though, I'm happy for you!	hit:524_conv:1048_4_55
Ya I have actually been a few times but it is still fun to go with your friends	hit:524_conv:1048_5_173
i was disgusted at the way the man was staring at me non-stop	hit:528_conv:1057_1_178
That's unfortunate. Some people just cannot help but act rude.	hit:528_conv:1057_2_64
yes, and i ended up getting a different taxi, i lost my money	hit:528_conv:1057_3_178
That's unfortunate. What do you think about Uber?	hit:528_conv:1057_4_64
it is reliable and efficient, i wish i had taken one that day	hit:528_conv:1057_5_178
my son brought home his first F today.	hit:529_conv:1058_1_175
That is a tough thing to deal with but hopefully his first F will also be his last.	hit:529_conv:1058_2_167
yea he is a smart kid I just think he has been playing too much fortnite.	hit:529_conv:1058_3_175

That was so bad. What kill the diver 	hit:530_conv:1060_2_166
They said he ran out of oxygen, while uderwater. That was weird since it happened after they located the team.	hit:530_conv:1060_3_158
It means he miscalculated the time he was to spend under the water. Sorry for him	hit:530_conv:1060_4_166
Yesterday i left my luggage behind for a stranger to look after it	hit:531_conv:1062_1_6
Why did u leave your luggage for a stranger	hit:531_conv:1062_2_181
That was so naive on my part, i had to leave shortly to buy a drink from the shop.	hit:531_conv:1062_3_6
Wao,its a mistake,	hit:531_conv:1062_4_181

Like the ones from Office space? haha	hit:533_conv:1067_3_165

I started a new job a few weeks ago I want to get promoted quickly	hit:539_conv:1079_1_173
You need to be patient. Getting promoted at your work place takes patience and perseverance 	hit:539_conv:1079_2_166
I have a good chance though it is a very small department 	hit:539_conv:1079_3_173

Sorry to hear that you did not get approved.	hit:544_conv:1089_2_167
It's ok, a car is another bill for me anyway. I'll keep taking Lyft.	hit:544_conv:1089_3_108
You are right about that. Owning a car can get expensive.	hit:544_conv:1089_4_167
What's your dream car?	hit:544_conv:1089_5_108
My dream car is a Chevy Camaro.	hit:544_conv:1089_6_167
That's a nice retro car, which year?	hit:544_conv:1089_7_108
Classic 1975 would be great.	hit:544_conv:1089_8_167
I had a couple rabbits once, interesting pets to take care of.	hit:545_conv:1091_1_158
Do you still have them?	hit:545_conv:1091_2_155
No, this was as a kid. The dog essentially killed one. Then the other one became more grumpy.	hit:545_conv:1091_3_158
Do you own any other pets now?	hit:545_conv:1091_4_155
So I was driving on the interstate and another car ran into the back of me.	hit:546_conv:1093_1_175
Wow.  Did you get hurt?  Sounds scary.	hit:546_conv:1093_2_160
No just the airbags went off and I hit my head and got a few bruises. 	hit:546_conv:1093_3_175
I am always scared about those airbags!  I am so glad you are ok!	hit:546_conv:1093_4_160

Wow, it was because you were young, that is why	hit:552_conv:1104_2_183
Back then, I felt like the world owed me something because of my bad childhood.	hit:552_conv:1104_3_108
It is really nothing, children behave like that sometimes	hit:552_conv:1104_4_183
You're right, we live and learn. Or at least we should.	hit:552_conv:1104_5_108

Do you think your friends are looking out for you?	hit:557_conv:1114_1_165
I only have a couple really good friends who are always there for me. The rest of my friends don't really care about me that much.	hit:557_conv:1114_2_139
I feel the same way. Maybe it's normal?	hit:557_conv:1114_3_165

Oh no! That's not very nice but I guess you can play it off by just acting cool and laughing it off. 	hit:566_conv:1132_2_152
i did but i feel so embarrassed 	hit:566_conv:1132_3_178
It's okay it's pretty funny, and it'll be forgotten about so quick anyhow. I know how it feels haha, we all do.	hit:566_conv:1132_4_152

Ok,where did he travel to?	hit:567_conv:1134_4_181
Back when I worked two jobs and went to school full-time, I overslept and was late to get my child from school..	hit:569_conv:1138_1_108
Yikes!  Schools get really mad about that, as well as it makes the kid worry.	hit:569_conv:1138_2_160
Yes, she was crying and it made me cry. I felt so irresponsible.	hit:569_conv:1138_3_108
Don't beat yourself up.  It happens all the time.  I am sure you are a loving parent!	hit:569_conv:1138_4_160
Yes indeed, I am. She is 17 years old now.	hit:569_conv:1138_5_108

That is awful. Was anyone else hurt?	hit:572_conv:1144_2_186
no, just the child, she was trying to cross the road with her dog	hit:572_conv:1144_3_178
Were there any signs that the driver might have been impared, as opposed to the breaks malfunctioning?	hit:572_conv:1144_4_186
no, the driver was okay, the problem was with the breaks	hit:572_conv:1144_5_178
I hope the child recovers from her injuries.	hit:572_conv:1144_6_186

I wasn't sure how it could have happened given how fast they would have been going.	hit:573_conv:1146_3_158
How fast were they going? 	hit:573_conv:1146_4_187

Wow, what really happened?	hit:576_conv:1153_2_183
I ended up paying rent and bills ahead 2 months instead. 	hit:576_conv:1153_3_108

I am trying to	hit:577_conv:1155_3_178
Do you get enough sleep. Being sleep deprived can make you lose focus 	hit:577_conv:1155_4_166
My day was really though, because I couldn't really focus on what I was doing just because I was espectant	hit:580_conv:1160_1_189

I can understand your position. How old is he?	hit:581_conv:1162_4_186
I was happy for her because that was her first sitting	hit:584_conv:1168_1_183
Is she a model?	hit:584_conv:1168_2_186
No, she is a medical student, always wanted to be a doctor	hit:584_conv:1168_3_183
"Oh, so what does a ""sitting"" entail?"	hit:584_conv:1168_4_186
But we waited and waited, she didn't still show up	hit:585_conv:1171_1_189
Who are you talking about? What happened?	hit:585_conv:1171_2_7
Went for a music concert in New York and was expecting to see Beyonce but she didn't show up	hit:585_conv:1171_3_189
That is bad. I hope you see her in another event.	hit:585_conv:1171_4_7

Yes, and now that I've added them on Facebook, they still don't interact with me.	hit:586_conv:1173_3_108
It can be really frustrating, seems like so many people have it good while so many have the short end of the stick	hit:586_conv:1173_4_63
I know, That's why it's best to find your own happiness.	hit:586_conv:1173_5_108

I went out with my friends	hit:647_conv:1294_3_183
Ah ok, was it fun then?	hit:647_conv:1294_4_63
Do you ever feel sad about anything?	hit:648_conv:1297_1_165
Oh yeah, I've been through quite a few sad things before. What about you?	hit:648_conv:1297_2_55
Yeah some. It's a part of life I guess.	hit:648_conv:1297_3_165
Definitely, the sad is needed to balance out the good.	hit:648_conv:1297_4_55
i am afraid of hospitals since my cousing was admitted due to injuries in a road accident. I saw alot of blood and sick people and the thought of going there scares me. 	hit:653_conv:1306_1_178
I figure we'll all be there at some point once we get old.	hit:653_conv:1306_2_158
i dont want to imagine	hit:653_conv:1306_3_178
My parents worked in them, so I am used to them.	hit:653_conv:1306_4_158
My cat disappeared, we figure it died.	hit:653_conv:1307_1_158

I was amazed because I thought he had no money, I was not expecting it	hit:664_conv:1329_1_183
Why? What was the unexpected thing that happened?	hit:664_conv:1329_2_190
That he bought me a watch, not just a watch but gold	hit:664_conv:1329_3_183
Who bought you this golden watch? Was it a wizard?	hit:664_conv:1329_4_190
One time at work I put together a shelf that had nonmatching parts.	hit:665_conv:1330_1_158
Oh? Is it more of art than purpose in its form? 	hit:665_conv:1330_2_187
It's more like there were leftover parts and we made do with what we had.	hit:665_conv:1330_3_158
Oh, I see. A workable shelf then. 	hit:665_conv:1330_4_187
It was a happy moment that day I checked my result, I was so afraid but later it varnished	hit:669_conv:1338_1_183
Hahaha hope you did very well	hit:669_conv:1338_2_189
Of course, very excellent result	hit:669_conv:1338_3_183

Wow, and you didn't get pulled over?	hit:671_conv:1343_2_205
No, I had not tried to max it out. But at 95 it pretty much shook and wouldn't go faster.	hit:671_conv:1343_3_158
Must've been some important meeting!	hit:671_conv:1343_4_205
I was flogged very well that day	hit:676_conv:1353_1_183
I don't know what flogging is.	hit:676_conv:1353_2_205
Wow, I mean I was disciplined	hit:676_conv:1353_3_183
"Looking up the definition tells me its punishment by being whipped or beaten, so unless you mean you were beaten metaphorically, you shouldn't be ""wowing"" me."	hit:676_conv:1353_4_205
I was amazed with the good performance I put up on stage yesterday 	hit:678_conv:1356_1_189

Noodles I guess	hit:685_conv:1371_3_189
Ok,have u prepared it?	hit:685_conv:1371_4_181
She was told that she will give birth through CS, but she delivered normal	hit:688_conv:1376_1_183
normal is the best way, it helps the mother bond with the child	hit:688_conv:1376_2_188
Exactly, and it helps the woman heal fast.	hit:688_conv:1376_3_183
we are adamant to have our baby born normal. I have seen first hand the CS mothers and their closeness (lack of) with their kids	hit:688_conv:1376_4_188
So many relationships are being spoilt by cheating and  unfaithfulness 	hit:690_conv:1380_1_189
You think so? 	hit:690_conv:1380_2_187
Yeah Cox I've been in that situation before	hit:690_conv:1380_3_189
Well, I've kept quite a few relationships throughout my life. If I actually wanted to look at online profiles, I do it mostly for research or investigative purposes. Other than that, I'm only interested in online chat. 	hit:690_conv:1380_4_187
I needed money this weekend 	hit:694_conv:1389_1_189

Oh no, I've had a few days like that. Did you laugh it off?	hit:705_conv:1411_2_202
Not really I was just mortified!! One shoe was plain black and the other had a pink bow on it at the front.  I had to walk about all day while the whole office couldnt stop laughing.  I think by the end of the day though I tried to see the funny side.	hit:705_conv:1411_3_208
Well good on you for toughing it out. Your the stronger for it.	hit:705_conv:1411_4_202
lol i dont know about that but I have definitely learnt to always have one last check of what Im wearing before I ever leave the house again!!	hit:705_conv:1411_5_208

I was really lonely sitting alone in the train	hit:719_conv:1438_1_189
that sucks. Sometimes it doesn't matter if you're surrounded by people, you can still feel alone	hit:719_conv:1438_2_188
Yeah most especially when you have no friend around	hit:719_conv:1438_3_189
the hardest lesson in life is that we're all alone	hit:719_conv:1438_4_188
Went for a music concert yesterday 	hit:726_conv:1453_1_189
Awesome. What type of music was played there?	hit:726_conv:1453_2_210
Hip pop  mostly,  they invited Beyonce but she didn't show up 	hit:726_conv:1453_3_189

He actually came back with a gold medal, I was actually doubting him for a while.	hit:727_conv:1455_1_101
Who came back with a gold medal? 	hit:727_conv:1455_2_187
My friend, he won the 100 metre sprint carnival.	hit:727_conv:1455_3_101
Oh, nice. Well, if you work upon on something, anything is possible if you work upon it. 	hit:727_conv:1455_4_187
Yes, because that's how I feel about it.	hit:729_conv:1458_1_153
Hello friend! May I ask what it that you feel that way about?	hit:729_conv:1458_2_209
It encourage to be impressed.	hit:729_conv:1458_3_153
I don't understand what you are talking about. Are you feeling okay today?	hit:729_conv:1458_4_209
You need to be happy for you to live longer	hit:732_conv:1464_1_189
of course, like they say happiness is contagious, if you are happy everything around you stays happy and it will be hard to die young	hit:732_conv:1464_2_210
Yeah for sure, that's why I always like to be happy 	hit:732_conv:1464_3_189
Also your home stays blessed because you become a more better partner	hit:732_conv:1464_4_210
My roommate and I used to plan for weeks to prepare for music festivals!	hit:737_conv:1475_1_218
Wow that must be lot of preparation 	hit:737_conv:1475_2_215
It was, but part of the fun was getting ready!  Sometimes the planning can be just as fun as the event!	hit:737_conv:1475_3_218
Where is this event going to be	hit:737_conv:1475_4_215
I have done all my paper work for my exam tomorrow, now i can relax until tomorrow.	hit:740_conv:1481_1_101

Oh wow, I am glad that you are okay.	hit:742_conv:1484_4_126
The other night I went outside to unplug the pool pump and saw a snake. We have poisonous snakes around us so I was a bit worried when I saw it. 	hit:744_conv:1489_1_61
Omg I would have ran faster than forest gump... what did you do? 	hit:744_conv:1489_2_11
I ran inside and got my husband out of bed. He killed it since we have little kids we didn't want to take a risk that it was poisonous. 	hit:744_conv:1489_3_61
Im glad no one was hurt! 	hit:744_conv:1489_4_11
I was on facebook and my memories popped up reminding me that I lost my dog to bone cancer three years ago.	hit:747_conv:1494_1_61
Oh no, I'm sure that was a hard memory to have brought up for you. 	hit:747_conv:1494_2_220
It was, she was a very special dog. One of the old souls with a heart of gold. I still miss her.	hit:747_conv:1494_3_61
What was her name? Have you read Rainbow Bridge?	hit:747_conv:1494_4_220
Yes, It is a beautiful poem! Her name was Skyber. 	hit:747_conv:1494_5_61
What a beautiful name! Hopefully your memories are more happy than sad now.	hit:747_conv:1494_6_220
I am so happy I was able to pass my teacher certification test and become an English teacher.	hit:748_conv:1496_1_221
That's great. Teachers are so important.	hit:748_conv:1496_2_27
It's such a fulfilling job. The test was difficult, but I spent a lot of my free time studying for it.	hit:748_conv:1496_3_221
I wanted to become a teacher before. I was afraid of how hard it would be.	hit:748_conv:1496_4_27
It's a lot of work, but if you really put in the effort, it becomes much easier.	hit:748_conv:1496_5_221
Well congratulations! I hope your students appreciate you as much as they should.	hit:748_conv:1496_6_27
I was in a back room in our house and everyone else was asleep. I heard a weird crinkling noise and was worried that someone had come in the house. 	hit:749_conv:1499_1_61
Oh my goodness, did you go to check what the noise was?	hit:749_conv:1499_2_220
I did, it turned out to be my cat playing with a play mat the kids left out. 	hit:749_conv:1499_3_61
I'm glad it wasn't anything serious! It's scary how quick our mind goes to the worst possible scenarios.	hit:749_conv:1499_4_220
When I turned 25 I got my first surprise party thanks to my parents.	hit:755_conv:1511_1_221
That's really cool of them. You weren't expecting it at all, hu?	hit:755_conv:1511_2_1
No. I just thought we were going to an early dinner together. 	hit:755_conv:1511_3_221
Parents can be great sometimes. Did you have a good time?	hit:755_conv:1511_4_1

Congratulations. Interviews can be stressful	hit:758_conv:1517_2_27
True. The interview I had before I got this job went so, so badly. I studied some common questions so I was ready the next time.	hit:758_conv:1517_3_221
Thats smart. And it worked.	hit:758_conv:1517_4_27

Nice. I like dogs.	hit:766_conv:1532_4_7
I went zip-lining in Thailand once. A nearby tree fell and part of it hit the platform we were on.	hit:789_conv:1579_1_221
Oh my that sounds so scary! Was everyone ok?	hit:789_conv:1579_2_230
We were all fine. A bit shaken up, but nobody got hurt thank goodness.	hit:789_conv:1579_3_221
Do you think you will ever zip line again?	hit:789_conv:1579_4_230
Oh yes. It was a great experience.	hit:789_conv:1579_5_221
My son experienced stranger anxiety and didn't want to be out in public.	hit:802_conv:1605_1_13
oh no. What do you do for that?	hit:802_conv:1605_2_27
We had to leave the restaurant before everyone could order drinks.	hit:802_conv:1605_3_13
Oh. How old is he?	hit:802_conv:1605_4_27
He is one and it was sad because I stay at home all day so that was my chance for some interaction.	hit:802_conv:1605_5_13
Today as soon as I got to work I got sick. I have a new coworker that stepped in and helped me out. Her works looks good but I'm nervous.	hit:827_conv:1654_1_60
Well, I hope you are feeling better. What makes you so nervous? Are you worried your superiors will look down on you leaving early?	hit:827_conv:1654_2_209
No we are allowed to help each other but I'm worried his code will not pass once the program is done. 	hit:827_conv:1654_3_60
I'm sure you can get in tomorrow and see how it looks. You can work together to make sure it works!	hit:827_conv:1654_4_209
I work so. I want to trust him but we have only worked together a few weeks. 	hit:827_conv:1654_5_60
I just upgraded the turbo on my car. I wanted more power but currently my VW can beat a corvette in a race. So I'm happy	hit:829_conv:1658_1_60
That is very cool! How much did it cost?	hit:829_conv:1658_2_241
I did all the work my self but the parts were around 4500 besides the price off the all work I've all ready done to it. I'm trying to build a grocery getter that I can take to the race track.	hit:829_conv:1658_3_60
Wow, sounds nice! Was it hard to do the work?	hit:829_conv:1658_4_241
Not really I enjoy working on cars. I work a white collar job so I went off work I like to do something different. 	hit:829_conv:1658_5_60
Hired 4 more people to join my crew at work last week. 2 all ready quit. I'm bummed. 	hit:831_conv:1663_1_60
Dang, that really stinks. Why did they quit so quickly?	hit:831_conv:1663_2_139
The  work was to physically hard for them. But I still had big hopes for them. 	hit:831_conv:1663_3_60
Perhaps you should screen new employees better? Like give them a physical performance test?	hit:831_conv:1663_4_139
I wish. It's hard to find anyone that is willing to work hard.	hit:831_conv:1663_5_60
We are supposed to do the amusement park, tomorrow but I think it may rain.	hit:835_conv:1671_1_26
I hope it's nice for you. Do you have any alternate plans?	hit:835_conv:1671_2_225
We do, but I think my friends want to do the amusement park as well as something else. I don't know if I have money for both.	hit:835_conv:1671_3_26
Well, that's always a problem for me too, but at least you've got another $1.25 now.	hit:835_conv:1671_4_225
Hello! I recently read an article about medical marijuana now being allowed in the united kingdom, What do you think about it?	hit:838_conv:1676_1_242
I think that is wonderful, it's about time more countries and states are making this medicine an option.	hit:838_conv:1676_2_127
the way it ended up being legalized, IMO, was a complete disgrace, they confiscated some childs weed who was epileptic, and as a result - predictably - he immediately started having seizured without it. Like gee, well done on torturing the kid! Do you think it was right to confiscate it, even though it technically wasnt legal at the time?	hit:838_conv:1676_3_242
No, but as Mark Twain once said, the law is an ass. 	hit:838_conv:1676_4_127
what an excellent quote 	hit:838_conv:1676_5_242
I'm glad they made the right decision eventually though. It's about time!	hit:838_conv:1676_6_127
The coolest race I saw was a high school 3200 meter relay.	hit:843_conv:1687_1_158
The coolest race I saw was late at night on the highway out of town.	hit:843_conv:1687_2_225
I am a bad driver, otherwise I might like it.	hit:843_conv:1687_3_158
Yeah, it can be pretty dangerous, but I was young.	hit:843_conv:1687_4_225
Sometimes I race after the stop light, but that's it.	hit:843_conv:1687_5_158
My hamster Donatello just died.	hit:887_conv:1774_1_250
I'm sorry to hear that. How long did you have him? 	hit:887_conv:1774_2_251
I had him for two years. He was my best friend.	hit:887_conv:1774_3_250
I bet pets are amazing. They're hard to replace once they're a part of the family	hit:887_conv:1774_4_251
Exactly, I just don't know how I'm going to get over it. I don't want another hamster I want Donatello back.	hit:887_conv:1774_5_250
I cant believe my brother snitched on me. He told my girlfriend I cheated on her.	hit:892_conv:1785_1_250
Oooh, that's rough. Did you make him mad?	hit:892_conv:1785_2_234
No, he just doesn't understand the meaning of loyalty.	hit:892_conv:1785_3_250
Well, I hope you can work things out at least	hit:892_conv:1785_4_234
I didnt like flying abroad	hit:893_conv:1787_1_255
Flying has seemingly become terrible these days. What about your trip was so bad?	hit:893_conv:1787_2_254
It was snowingh really bad and the plane had to land in SC instead of Chicago	hit:893_conv:1787_3_255
That sounds frustrating and a little scary.  Did you eventually make it to your destination?	hit:893_conv:1787_4_254
No, I decided to cancel and eventually went home next day.It was the best idea.	hit:893_conv:1787_5_255
That's too bad.  But better safe than sorry.	hit:893_conv:1787_6_254
Yea that was the idea. Go back to safety zone. No place like home. Have you traveled much ?	hit:893_conv:1787_7_255
Not too much.  I used to fly a lot but not anymore.  I stick around home now mostly.	hit:893_conv:1787_8_254
I miss beating my brother in the Pokemon card game everyday.	hit:894_conv:1788_1_250
Well, have you tried reliving that through the Pokemon app that you can interact with?	hit:894_conv:1788_2_249
No, I need the real thing it just doesn't feel the same.	hit:894_conv:1788_3_250
Yes, I can understand that.. Sometimes nothing compares.. Have you guys played recently?	hit:894_conv:1788_4_249
My boyfriend had to go out of town for a few days and I was left alone in the apartment. I didn't have many friends here at the time.	hit:895_conv:1790_1_13
I know how that feels. I bet it was boring and lonely.	hit:895_conv:1790_2_243
Yeah, it was. I didn't have much to do all that weekend and the apartment was quiet.	hit:895_conv:1790_3_13
Did you get out and do anything?	hit:895_conv:1790_4_243
My son starts kindergarten next month. I don't know what I will do since I don't work.	hit:899_conv:1798_1_26
That really is a big change for you! Are you excited to have some more down time?	hit:899_conv:1798_2_249
"I am but also not sure how I feel like him ""leaving the nest"". "	hit:899_conv:1798_3_26
Yeah, that feeling will change when you see him coming home with a huge smile on his face!	hit:899_conv:1798_4_249
I hope so!	hit:899_conv:1798_5_26
I was flying to Alaska and it was a nervewracking flight.	hit:901_conv:1803_1_259
Was it a long flight? Or was there lots of turbulance? 	hit:901_conv:1803_2_258
It was about 9 hours. A little bit of turbulance. I just have nothing to do on flights.	hit:901_conv:1803_3_259
Ah, I can't imagine being up in the air that long! Sounds like it was a boring flight too. 	hit:901_conv:1803_4_258
Well the sights outside were pretty	hit:901_conv:1803_5_259
I guess that is one positive! 	hit:901_conv:1803_6_258
I studied all night and I still flunked my math test. I can't believe it!	hit:905_conv:1810_1_250
Did you study hard?	hit:905_conv:1810_2_4
Yes, it just baffles me. Maybe next time I shouldn't even study.	hit:905_conv:1810_3_250
No, you should keep studying.	hit:905_conv:1810_4_4
I really wanted a certain job and I did not get it	hit:906_conv:1813_1_259
That stinks, it's never worth giving up though! What line of work do you prefer?	hit:906_conv:1813_2_249
Video work. It is very competitive.	hit:906_conv:1813_3_259
I can definitely believe that.. I hope something opens up for you soon!	hit:906_conv:1813_4_249
It was so fun!	hit:908_conv:1816_1_260
What was so fun?	hit:908_conv:1816_2_249
Taking my dog to the dog park!	hit:908_conv:1816_3_260
Oh yeah!!! I love taking my dog too, she gets to get all that dang energy out before I bring her back to our little apartment!	hit:908_conv:1816_4_249
Yeah, my golden retriever is really happy to meet people. For some reason he doesn't care much for other dogs.	hit:908_conv:1816_5_260
I really miss my dog who passed away.	hit:910_conv:1821_1_259
That sucks, I love dogs.	hit:910_conv:1821_2_4
Me too. She is a better place now.	hit:910_conv:1821_3_259
Yes I am sure she it.	hit:910_conv:1821_4_4
The other day I lost control of my car and got in a huge wreck. My leg broke, but I knew I would walk again.	hit:911_conv:1823_1_250
Wow.. That is horrific!  I'm so glad you're okay.. Was anyone else hurt?	hit:911_conv:1823_2_249
No, by the grace of god. He protects me at all times.	hit:911_conv:1823_3_250
Awesome. I am so glad to hear that.. Always good to hear the stories were someone gets away!!	hit:911_conv:1823_4_249
I hate when I make plans and the rain cancels them....	hit:912_conv:1825_1_260
I agree with that! I just had the rain cancel my trip to the beach yesterday! Makes me so mad...	hit:912_conv:1825_2_249
Yeah, some people like the rain! I don't get how.....	hit:912_conv:1825_3_260
I mean I like the rain at certain times.. But not when I'm trying to do fun stuff outside!	hit:912_conv:1825_4_249
At least it's the summer so being in the rain doesn't make you freezing cold! If you're in the northern hemisphere that is.	hit:912_conv:1825_5_260
I'm planning to return to college for engineering which should be cool.	hit:915_conv:1831_1_260
That is such a brilliant idea, are you excited about it?	hit:915_conv:1831_2_249
Yeah, I have more years left.	hit:915_conv:1831_3_260
That's awesome, you'll thank yourself later down the road for making yourself do it!	hit:915_conv:1831_4_249
I hope to get a cool job, not sure what industry I want to be in, maybe cars or airplanes.	hit:915_conv:1831_5_260
I caught somebody stealing a package from my front yard on surveillance.	hit:927_conv:1855_1_250
Oh wow! I have heard of that happening to lots of people. Did they get arrested?	hit:927_conv:1855_2_228
Not yet. People these days just don't care. They steal anything they lay their eyes on!	hit:927_conv:1855_3_250
Yes they do. It has gotten really bad around here with car thefts. It's no wonder are car insurance rates are so high.	hit:927_conv:1855_4_228
I just got back from buying a few groceries at the store. 	hit:928_conv:1857_1_26
Oh really? What'd ya get?	hit:928_conv:1857_2_1
Just stuff for dinner. At the checkout, a guy took my receipt!	hit:928_conv:1857_3_26
Why did he do that?	hit:928_conv:1857_4_1
I am not sure. He was on his phone though.	hit:928_conv:1857_5_26
I studied really hard for my math test last week, so I knew I would ace it.	hit:930_conv:1861_1_250
Math is a tough subject. Good for you.	hit:930_conv:1861_2_1
I know, I feel like I can solve math problems that even Einstein couldn't solve.	hit:930_conv:1861_3_250
Being good at math will open lots of opportunities for you. Keep at it.	hit:930_conv:1861_4_1
We have taken many unplanned trips this summer that I didn't have money for. But I was able to pick up more work and pay for them.	hit:935_conv:1870_1_26
How exciting that you were able to do that. I hope it was fun.	hit:935_conv:1870_2_226
It has been a fun summer! I am so tired though.	hit:935_conv:1870_3_26
It's funny how you need a vacation to recover from vacation.	hit:935_conv:1870_4_226
Oh yes! I have so many pictures to go through though!	hit:935_conv:1870_5_26
I had a major project and felt very ready to present it to everyone at the office	hit:945_conv:1890_1_111
How'd it go	hit:945_conv:1890_2_1
It went well, I think I gained confidence by being so prepared	hit:945_conv:1890_3_111
That's great. Do you present often?	hit:945_conv:1890_4_1
I was walking home late at night and noticed I was being followed	hit:946_conv:1893_1_111
Oh no, what happened?	hit:946_conv:1893_2_1
I ended up running back to my place	hit:946_conv:1893_3_111
Glad you are safe!	hit:946_conv:1893_4_1
My girlfriend seems to be distant and talking to other guys	hit:948_conv:1897_1_111
Have you talked to her about it?	hit:948_conv:1897_2_1
Not yet, she's also been texting other guys as well I think	hit:948_conv:1897_3_111
That doesn't sound too good. Has she been like this before?	hit:948_conv:1897_4_1
I finished a team based project with some co-workers	hit:952_conv:1905_1_111
Was it fun? Interesting? Engaging?	hit:952_conv:1905_2_234
Yeah, it was fun, and we did so well	hit:952_conv:1905_3_111
Good! Team based projects can be very hit or miss depending on your team so I'm glad it worked out for you	hit:952_conv:1905_4_234
My girlfriend broke up with me	hit:954_conv:1909_1_111
Did she give you a reason?	hit:954_conv:1909_2_75
She fell out of love with me	hit:954_conv:1909_3_111
Sorry to hear that, i hope you find somebody else in your life.	hit:954_conv:1909_4_75
I left my wallet behind by accident	hit:955_conv:1911_1_111
Sorry to hear that.Did you lose money?	hit:955_conv:1911_2_75
I left in the bathroom and was able to get it back	hit:955_conv:1911_3_111
So, you never actually lost the wallet.	hit:955_conv:1911_4_75
A friend threw a birthday party for me	hit:956_conv:1912_1_111
That sounds amazing! How did it go?	hit:956_conv:1912_2_9
It was a lot of fun, I had no idea he was planning it	hit:956_conv:1912_3_111
That's amazing, I have only had one brithday party like that in my life.	hit:956_conv:1912_4_9
I found some old toys of mine	hit:958_conv:1917_1_111
What kind?	hit:958_conv:1917_2_4
Some action figures I had when I was younger, I felt pretty nostalgic	hit:958_conv:1917_3_111
I use to have a G.I Joe.	hit:958_conv:1917_4_4
A friend of mine was sick	hit:961_conv:1922_1_111
What were they sick from?	hit:961_conv:1922_2_4
Flu, I went over and gave him some food and medicine	hit:961_conv:1922_3_111
That was nice of you.	hit:961_conv:1922_4_4
A friend who I hadn't seen in awhile showed up at my door	hit:962_conv:1925_1_111
I'll bet you were surprised. Were you glad to see them?	hit:962_conv:1925_2_226
I was very happy to see him, we ended up going out for drinks	hit:962_conv:1925_3_111
Did you reconnect and promise to keep in touch?	hit:962_conv:1925_4_226
I met a girl I hadn't seen in some tme	hit:969_conv:1939_1_111

No, but we did end up going out on a date	hit:969_conv:1939_3_111
That is great, did you have fun?	hit:969_conv:1939_4_4
I really hated it when my dog got into the trash. It spilled everywhere.	hit:970_conv:1940_1_259
Yeah, thats rough. I hate having to clean up mess that wasn't my fault.	hit:970_conv:1940_2_269
Yeah, it was pretty gross. A lot of rotten food.	hit:970_conv:1940_3_259
Yeah, that sounds annoying. Maybe try to scold the dog so they won't do it again?	hit:970_conv:1940_4_269
I did. He is just a puppy, so hopefully he will grow out of it.	hit:970_conv:1940_5_259
I really miss my dog. We had to put her down.	hit:972_conv:1945_1_259
That sucks. What was his name?	hit:972_conv:1945_2_4
Barney. He was such a good boy.	hit:972_conv:1945_3_259
Barney was the name of my hamster.	hit:972_conv:1945_4_4
I was very anxious to start driving at 16.	hit:974_conv:1948_1_259
I know that feeling. It's nerve racking trying to incorporate everything you learned at the DMV in real time.	hit:974_conv:1948_2_269
It really is. It's like I can't remember all the rules of the road.	hit:974_conv:1948_3_259
It's also scary thinking about getting in a car accident the whole time, that would definitely get me nervous.	hit:974_conv:1948_4_269
I cannot wait to see Taylor Swift in concert!	hit:975_conv:1950_1_259
My wife, LOVES taylor swift. 	hit:975_conv:1950_2_9
I actually went to high school with her. I cannot believe she is as famous as she is.	hit:975_conv:1950_3_259
That is awesome, I went to high school with Brett Favre! Small world.	hit:975_conv:1950_4_9
A female coworker came onto me at work the other day, but I refused her advances because I love my wife.	hit:1000_conv:2000_1_250
I am glad you love her, it must be a nice feeling	hit:1000_conv:2000_2_126
Yes, I just can't see myself being with another woman.	hit:1000_conv:2000_3_250
That is a good thing then	hit:1000_conv:2000_4_126
I cant believe I got arrested for a DUI this weekend, I let myself down.	hit:1038_conv:2077_1_250
That wasn't smart.	hit:1038_conv:2077_2_4
I know I promised myself I wasn't going to drink anymore.	hit:1038_conv:2077_3_250
Why did you then?	hit:1038_conv:2077_4_4
I feel good about my last semester. I think I'll do better in my engineering classes this fall.	hit:1044_conv:2089_1_260
Dang.. my old roommate was an engineering student. He always told me how hard it was. What kind of engineering?	hit:1044_conv:2089_2_273
I'm doing mechanical, it's pretty hard but it's interesting. A career in the field would be awesome!	hit:1044_conv:2089_3_260
Yeah, I think once you get in the field, you're set. The jobs seem to pay well. Good luck with that, you sound like you know what you're doing.	hit:1044_conv:2089_4_273
Thanks, I hope I can keep it up, good luck to you as well!	hit:1044_conv:2089_5_260
I hate taking the but, today I was late to my stop and got there just as it drove away....	hit:1062_conv:2125_1_260
Oh, the bus? Yeah I bet that was a little embarrassing. Sorry to hear that. I take my car for granted. Maybe you will get one someday.	hit:1062_conv:2125_2_273
I drove my parents' old car for a little, and i definitely took that for granted until it broke down lol. I'm trying to save up, I hope I get one too.	hit:1062_conv:2125_3_260
Well, keep working at it. It's a process. 	hit:1062_conv:2125_4_273
Absolutely. I also enjoy biking around sometimes because its green and gets you some exercise.	hit:1062_conv:2125_5_260
I can't wait until I see my golden retriever Blue this weekend!	hit:1064_conv:2128_1_260

Yup goldens are happy about pretty much anything lol :) Do you have any pets?	hit:1064_conv:2128_5_260
I saw a colleague stealing money at work. I wonder if I did the right thing by not telling my boss.	hit:1065_conv:2130_1_250
Is there a reason why you didn't tell your boss?	hit:1065_conv:2130_2_281
I just didn't want to be labeled as a snitch, but now I'm having second thoughts.	hit:1065_conv:2130_3_250
Is there a way you could report it anonymously?	hit:1065_conv:2130_4_281
I hate when it rains, especially for several days at a time.	hit:1070_conv:2140_1_260
Oh I do too! I like a nice sunny day.	hit:1070_conv:2140_2_20
How has the weather been where you are.	hit:1070_conv:2140_3_260
It's been really rainy. My power just went out awhile ago.	hit:1070_conv:2140_4_20
Oh no, does that happen a lot when it rains near you?	hit:1070_conv:2140_5_260
Yes it makes me pretty upset to be honest.	hit:1070_conv:2140_6_20
Hopefully it doesn't rain this week but the forecast is at least 60% all week!	hit:1070_conv:2140_7_260
I remember when we used to compete with Yo-Yo's to see who could do the best tricks.	hit:1071_conv:2142_1_250
"My brother used to have a yo-yo! He did a trick called ""Around the world"" and also one called ""The cradle."" Know those?"	hit:1071_conv:2142_2_273
"Yes, my favorite was called ""Walk the dog""."	hit:1071_conv:2142_3_250
Oh yeah! I remember that! I wasn't good at doing any of them. I mostly just watched him. Good memories.	hit:1071_conv:2142_4_273
Last week we were at an amusement park and I cant believe my little brother got on the roller coaster with us. He's usually afraid of heights.	hit:1081_conv:2162_1_250
Oh man I would have terrified I hate being up so high. He sounds really brave!	hit:1081_conv:2162_2_13
I know, he usually never goes on dangerous rides.	hit:1081_conv:2162_3_250
Did he go on anymore after that?	hit:1081_conv:2162_4_13
My son got spaghetti all over himself at dinner at a restaurant one night.	hit:1081_conv:2163_1_13
Well he's young, so you can't really fault him.	hit:1081_conv:2163_2_250
I didn't really care too much. I had remembered to pack him an extra set of clothes though.	hit:1081_conv:2163_3_13
That's good. You seem like a great parent.	hit:1081_conv:2163_4_250
I hate when it is storming it makes me so uncomfortable. 	hit:1087_conv:2175_1_284
does it happen often in your part of the country?	hit:1087_conv:2175_2_238
Yes especially in the summer time storms are bad and hurricanes are at a high I hide under my covers lol.	hit:1087_conv:2175_3_284
wow.  i can only imagine	hit:1087_conv:2175_4_238
I was using the toilet at Walmart yesterday and somebody walked in on me.	hit:1115_conv:2231_1_250
Thats nuts.	hit:1115_conv:2231_2_4
Whats worse is that I was in the wrong restroom. It was the girls restroom. I just wanted to get out of there as fast as I could.	hit:1115_conv:2231_3_250
Did she scream?	hit:1115_conv:2231_4_4
I was finally going to get to see dolphins up close.	hit:1121_conv:2242_1_13
Did you get to? What happened?	hit:1121_conv:2242_2_99
I went to Sea World for the very first time. We got to feed the dolphins.	hit:1121_conv:2242_3_13
I have never been there! Sounds fun, but I don't support Sea World and the way they treat their animals.	hit:1121_conv:2242_4_99
Last week there was a huge tarantula on my wall. I thought it was going to jump on me.	hit:1127_conv:2254_1_250
OH GOSH! I would burn the whole house down. i'm terrified of spiders and bugs	hit:1127_conv:2254_2_50
OMG me too! I hit it with a rolled up news paper and a bunch of baby spiders came out. I had a panic attack and stomped on them.	hit:1127_conv:2254_3_250
i would have a heart attack!	hit:1127_conv:2254_4_50
I will never forget the first time I felt old. I saw a video of grandparents playing with grandchildren and I realized it had been awhile since I did those things.	hit:1139_conv:2278_1_122
I know how you feel. Life is too short.	hit:1139_conv:2278_2_250
yes, I try to remind myself that I still have a lot to offer.	hit:1139_conv:2278_3_122
Yes, you do! Just keep living everyday like your last.	hit:1139_conv:2278_4_250
Yesterday we had a pool party. My brother got drunk and did a back flip off the roof and landed in the pool.	hit:1139_conv:2279_1_250
wow, I never did understand why people want to get drunk in the first place. I sure hope he wasn't hurt.	hit:1139_conv:2279_2_122
I wasn't mad at him. I just never knew he was that athletic.	hit:1139_conv:2279_3_250
it does sound like an amzing feat	hit:1139_conv:2279_4_122
I got on social media yesterday and saw that my friends went to a party, but they didn't invite me.	hit:1143_conv:2286_1_250
ohh that's rough...did you talk to them about it	hit:1143_conv:2286_2_119
No, sometimes I feel like they just don't understand me.	hit:1143_conv:2286_3_250
do they give you any kind of value...or do they just ignore you / put you down 90% of the time?	hit:1143_conv:2286_4_119
Awhile back I was taking a relative to get a heart cath. The surgeon sent for me to enter the operating room.	hit:1144_conv:2288_1_122
Is your relative okay now?	hit:1144_conv:2288_2_1
oh yes, thank you for asking. other family members just got a call and told them everything went ok. Kind of scary when I was sent for.	hit:1144_conv:2288_3_122
It must've have been. Glad they are okay now.	hit:1144_conv:2288_4_1
I got teary eyed when I watched my little brother get his diploma at graduation.	hit:1148_conv:2296_1_250
Congratulations to him! You must be proud.	hit:1148_conv:2296_2_1
I am, every time he succeeds, I succeed. I love my big headed brother.	hit:1148_conv:2296_3_250
He's very lucky to have you.	hit:1148_conv:2296_4_1
I was supposed to drive a friend to work	hit:1153_conv:2306_1_111
oh yeah what happened? 	hit:1153_conv:2306_2_11
I forgot to pick him up as I overslept	hit:1153_conv:2306_3_111
omg is he upset? 	hit:1153_conv:2306_4_11
A friend needed help moving	hit:1154_conv:2308_1_111
So did you help him / her	hit:1154_conv:2308_2_119
Yeah, he didn't know of anyone else to turn to for help so I gave him a hand	hit:1154_conv:2308_3_111
That's pretty nice of you	hit:1154_conv:2308_4_119
Yesterday my friend bought the Ferrari I always wanted. I deserve it more than him.	hit:1155_conv:2310_1_250
Wow, thats a nice car	hit:1155_conv:2310_2_126
Yes, I don't know how a clown like him ended up with one before I did.	hit:1155_conv:2310_3_250
It happens sometimes I guess	hit:1155_conv:2310_4_126
I was thinking about my old neighborhood	hit:1166_conv:2332_1_111
Memories.. what state? 	hit:1166_conv:2332_2_11
Can't say, but I was mostly just thinking about the friends I had there growing up	hit:1166_conv:2332_3_111
I understand but memories are always nice. 	hit:1166_conv:2332_4_11
I needed to use my car to drive somewhere, but couldn't	hit:1175_conv:2351_1_111
What happened with your car then?	hit:1175_conv:2351_2_68
My car was hit while parked	hit:1175_conv:2351_3_111
Ugh! that stinks! Did you found out who did it?	hit:1175_conv:2351_4_68
I was at a Journey concert with my son and he had to go to the bathroom while they were switching out performers. 	hit:1187_conv:2375_1_26
I would love that show	hit:1187_conv:2375_2_126
It was a very good show, but the people were so rude. We had to squeeze through a crazy crowd and didn't make it to the bathroom in time.	hit:1187_conv:2375_3_26
Oh well, it happens	hit:1187_conv:2375_4_126
i am suffering from severe fever for the past two days i don't have any energy 	hit:1194_conv:2389_1_199
Have you been to the doctor?	hit:1194_conv:2389_2_27
yes i had. he prescribed medicine for curing 	hit:1194_conv:2389_3_199
You will be fine then	hit:1194_conv:2389_4_27
i will take care of my self. thank you so much for your concern. take care of you too.	hit:1194_conv:2389_5_199
Sometimes I'm surprised my son is actually my son. He currently has enough merit aid to pay for 2/3 of his college tuition!	hit:1238_conv:2476_1_218
Well that is quite the accomplishment. 	hit:1238_conv:2476_2_297
It is certainly much better than I was ever able to do.  I think my scholarship was $500 and I had no merit aide.  He set his academic bar high... I just told him to do his best.	hit:1238_conv:2476_3_218
He sounds like he has a great head on his shoulder. You must have taught him well.	hit:1238_conv:2476_4_297
I now have a new boss, and today was my first day of a leadership meeting with him.  You never know how you will be received.	hit:1244_conv:2489_1_218
Oh man, that's so nerve-wracking. Do you think you guys will be a good fit?	hit:1244_conv:2489_2_273
He spent some time laying out his beliefs and his expectations, and I have to say, I agreed with all but one of them.  That's pretty good.  He spent a lot of time watching the rest of us interact with each other, so I think he is trying to feel us out without making judgments yet.	hit:1244_conv:2489_3_218
Then it sounds like at least he has some perspective and ability to know not to overreact. I guess you could say you lucked out, but that may be me speaking too prematurely	hit:1244_conv:2489_4_273
My mother will be 85 in a few days. My sister planned a surprise party knowing the day, hour and location would be very difficult for me to attend.	hit:1246_conv:2492_1_122
I hope you make it. Thats a big birthday.	hit:1246_conv:2492_2_27
It is day after tomorrow and I am still not certain I can work it out. Sometimes people are very inconsiderate.	hit:1246_conv:2492_3_122
That not good. Maybe she will understand if you just can't make it.	hit:1246_conv:2492_4_27
My cousin just called with the craziest story. She and her family are locked inside a cemetery.	hit:1253_conv:2507_1_122
Wow... That would be one of my worst fears. How did they even manage to do that?	hit:1253_conv:2507_2_273
They had gone to a fair and decided to stop on their way home and walk around. I guess her husband lost track of time. The worst thing is they haven't eaten anything since about noon.	hit:1253_conv:2507_3_122
Wow! Any way they can get out? Did they call someone?	hit:1253_conv:2507_4_273
You hope your teens make the right choices, but sometimes even the right choices feel wrong.  He is choosing to be away with friends and not at home much.  I believe this is healthy, but I can help but want something different.	hit:1260_conv:2520_1_218
I know it is hard to start letting go, but it gets easier with time.  Don't worry, you are not alone.	hit:1260_conv:2520_2_277
"That's what my own mother says.  In fact, she said my dad had a harder time than she did when I called and said, ""Hey, I'm staying the night at so and so's, be back tomorrow.""  I guess I will survive!  Hopefully he will choose to spend time here as he hits his 20s!"	hit:1260_conv:2520_3_218
Yeah, they always seem to come back!  You just have to love them from afar for  a while.	hit:1260_conv:2520_4_277
I witness a great sight. I saw a gas station attendant leave his post to pump gas for a lady who has a hard time getting around.	hit:1269_conv:2538_1_122
That's really sweet. We don't have gas station attendants here. But that's nice that they're that helpful.	hit:1269_conv:2538_2_273
The one I refer to is more like a cashier. He is supposed to stay in a little shack and collect money and turn the pumps on. The lady offered him a tip and he wouldn't take it.	hit:1269_conv:2538_3_122
Ohh, that makes sense. Yeah, then that's really nice of them! And really sweet of her to offer a tip. I guess there's good in the world after all.	hit:1269_conv:2538_4_273
I have been fortunate to live a good life but I found a lump in my neck.  Most people would get it checked out immediately.  I waited.  I was scared to get the news.	hit:1273_conv:2547_1_218
I would absolutely be scared too. Good news or bad, I would be a worried wreck beforehand. Have you gotten it checked out yet?	hit:1273_conv:2547_2_220
I finally went to an ENT doctor in May.  They biopsied it, and that was the most nerve-wracking five days I have ever waited.  It WAS good news, but still had to have removed.	hit:1273_conv:2547_3_218
I'm so glad to hear it was good news, though!	hit:1273_conv:2547_4_220
Even when life is tough and seems very unfair I have done my best to care for my family.	hit:1281_conv:2563_1_122
Thats great of you. Life is VERY unfair but we can go at any minute, so cherish those you love!	hit:1281_conv:2563_2_296
It can be difficult. But I learned early on retaliating helps nothing.	hit:1281_conv:2563_3_122
It doesn't help us no. But you must take care of yourself too- Take some time for yourself when being a caregiver ok!	hit:1281_conv:2563_4_296
I am off work for a month in the summer, but I today was my first day back, and it felt great to be back on a routine!	hit:1283_conv:2566_1_218
Coming back to work could be good after a break.	hit:1283_conv:2566_2_7
"A month is a great break to ""get away from the daily grind"" but believe me, at the end of week one you think oh, I have all the time in the world, and you aren't as productive."	hit:1283_conv:2566_3_218
I understand	hit:1283_conv:2566_4_7
I still can't believe I did that. My power had been off and I didn't even realize it.	hit:1288_conv:2577_1_122
That isn't good.	hit:1288_conv:2577_2_4
I arrived at church just as everyone was leaving. Boy did I feel awkward	hit:1288_conv:2577_3_122
Did anyone help you?	hit:1288_conv:2577_4_4
When I was pregnant, I thought so much about what my son would make me feel!	hit:1299_conv:2598_1_26
I wish I could feel that feeling, (unfortunately, I am a man). What did you end up naming your son?	hit:1299_conv:2598_2_209
I named him George, men can have feelings of their sons too. Hopefully one day you will as well.	hit:1299_conv:2598_3_26
I am greatly looking towards starting a family with my wife as well. George is such a nice name.	hit:1299_conv:2598_4_209
Thank you! My husband was excited when I was pregnant, but I don't think he got it until he arrived.	hit:1299_conv:2598_5_26
Have you ever been hospitalized? It's not much fun. I had a mini stroke and was stuck there for a few days.	hit:1302_conv:2605_1_122
I have - but not for anything that severe. Are you suffering any side effects of the stroke?	hit:1302_conv:2605_2_209
I am 99% me  The hardest part of the hospitalization was at the end of the day when my last visitor would go home. I am not good at being alone.	hit:1302_conv:2605_3_122
Yup - I know that feeling. And it's always so hard falling asleep in those uncomfortable beds with an IV in your arm.	hit:1302_conv:2605_4_209
I have a full time job that doesn't pay anything.	hit:1304_conv:2609_1_26
That really sucks man. Are you planning on looking for a new one?	hit:1304_conv:2609_2_209
I love my job, it involves my five year old kid and my eighty year old grandma.	hit:1304_conv:2609_3_26
Well, as long as you're doing something you enjoy, that's all that really matters.	hit:1304_conv:2609_4_209
It does! I love being there with my family.	hit:1304_conv:2609_5_26
I have a table that is somewhat unsteady, I put my computer on there because I have no where else to put it. 	hit:1311_conv:2622_1_26
Have you figured out what's the problem?	hit:1311_conv:2622_2_269
I have not, it seems to do ok except when my son puts his foot on there even though I tell him repeatedly not to do that!	hit:1311_conv:2622_3_26
Sounds like maybe one of the legs on the table is bent? 	hit:1311_conv:2622_4_269
It could be, I just hate when he doesn't listen!	hit:1311_conv:2622_5_26
My 2 year old daughter keeps picking up random words lately.	hit:1315_conv:2631_1_305
Yes? thats so cute, but you have to be carefull not to say bad words in fron of them	hit:1315_conv:2631_2_47
I know!  She said the f word!	hit:1315_conv:2631_3_305
OMG, well it is a bad thing but now you can be more polite in front of them, and also when you are not with them!	hit:1315_conv:2631_4_47
I went to a concert last weekend and saved the tickets.	hit:1317_conv:2635_1_26
Are you keeping it as a souvenir?	hit:1317_conv:2635_2_269
I am, I plan to scrapbook it once I get the pictures back.	hit:1317_conv:2635_3_26
Nice, I do that sometimes with movie tickets if it's a great movie that I enjoed a lot.	hit:1317_conv:2635_4_269
We recently went camping.  Everyone definitely gets closer in such close quarters!	hit:1320_conv:2640_1_305
I've been camping a few times - the proximity to others makes me feel stuffy too. Where do you usually go?	hit:1320_conv:2640_2_209
We went by a lake.  I accidentally opened the bathroom door with someone in it!	hit:1320_conv:2640_3_305
Oh wow! I bet the person inside would've pooped his pants, but there was probably none left!	hit:1320_conv:2640_4_209
This Spring has really made me appreciate family.	hit:1324_conv:2648_1_305
What happened?? Did you guys went camping or something?	hit:1324_conv:2648_2_75
My grandmother fell ill, and passed away.	hit:1324_conv:2648_3_305
Ho, I am sorry to hear that.	hit:1324_conv:2648_4_75
I got a notification on my phone that I had a package delivered and went to look for it	hit:1329_conv:2658_1_26
Too late I already took it. Just kidding, did you find it?	hit:1329_conv:2658_2_269
I did, they left it sitting in the middle of the driveway so it could get run over!	hit:1329_conv:2658_3_26
Oh, that's bad. Was there anything important in it?	hit:1329_conv:2658_4_269
It was some pills for my dog, luckily I found it before it got run over. 	hit:1329_conv:2658_5_26
My son and wife are coming for a visit. Been a long time since I have seen them	hit:1334_conv:2669_1_122
Wao thats so cool you must so excited, how long has it been?	hit:1334_conv:2669_2_47
about a year. I am on the east coast and they moved out west	hit:1334_conv:2669_3_122
Wao it must be very difficult to be separated from your wife and son, sorry	hit:1334_conv:2669_4_47
I went to a hockey game with my five year old son earlier this year. I had to bring lots of supplies!	hit:1335_conv:2670_1_26
Oh yeah? Do you have to do that every game?	hit:1335_conv:2670_2_297
When I have my son with us I do! My husband was shocked when he said he wanted his blanket and I pulled one out of my purse!	hit:1335_conv:2670_3_26
Thats funny. Well at least it sounds like you are always prepared. 	hit:1335_conv:2670_4_297
I have been married for ten years. Since we aren't swingers, I'm a one man kinda lady.	hit:1339_conv:2678_1_26
That's cool. I am not a swinger either.	hit:1339_conv:2678_2_4
Staying with the same guy day in and day out over a long period of time can be tough.	hit:1339_conv:2678_3_26
How did you do it?	hit:1339_conv:2678_4_4
It's a commitment to stay with just one person.	hit:1339_conv:2678_5_26
"After a full year of trying to get a leak fixed, I got help from a neighbor's roofer, who ""knew a guy.""  He said the guy didn't work on roofs, so I was confused!"	hit:1342_conv:2684_1_218
That makes no sense.	hit:1342_conv:2684_2_4
"Exactly!  The roofer told me that since I replaced my roof and the leak was still there, the problem had to be my fireplace chimney.  He said stone chimneys often develop leaks.  As it turns out, this chimney guy fabricates a type of gutter for chimneys to keep the water from running down the rock.  For $300 he made and installed the ""gutter"" on site, and I have had NO leaks!"	hit:1342_conv:2684_3_218
That seems like a good price.	hit:1342_conv:2684_4_4
its so hot here. i've had to shower like 3-4 times a day cause you start sweating anyway and it feels icky. Hows the temperature at your place?	hit:1354_conv:2709_1_242
right now it's freezing in my home lol I just got out of bed after 30 mins of sitting because it's coold	hit:1354_conv:2709_2_257

haha i live in virginia where right now the temperture outside is muggy 85 degress just regular ac pumping in my home	hit:1354_conv:2709_4_257
ooooh you have an AC, thats why. I live in europe and AC's...arent a thing at all, only the occasional pharmacy will have an AC	hit:1354_conv:2709_5_242
aw man that must suck how do you huys keep cool through the summer	hit:1354_conv:2709_6_257
we dont, icecream and cold drinks is literally it. 	hit:1354_conv:2709_7_242
Oops. I meant I was upset when my dog died.	hit:1383_conv:2766_1_255
I'm sorry, How long has it been?	hit:1383_conv:2766_2_225
Happened in Febuary.	hit:1383_conv:2766_3_255
That's always a tragedy.	hit:1383_conv:2766_4_225
Yea she was 12 yaers old, and had cataracts, so I knew it would happen someday	hit:1383_conv:2766_5_255
Last week, my girlfriend invited me to meet her parents. The whole time I was on edge because I wanted to make a good impression.	hit:1398_conv:2796_1_250
That's nerve wracking for sure.  How did it go?	hit:1398_conv:2796_2_310
Well we had dinner and the whole time a was stuttering because her father was asking very personal questions, but I think they liked me.	hit:1398_conv:2796_3_250
It probably went well, despite the common jokes most parents want their child to date someone good so try to look for the best in people.	hit:1398_conv:2796_4_310
We love going on our annual family camping trip, and just got back from it!	hit:1431_conv:2862_1_305
Oh nice! How long did you guys stay?	hit:1431_conv:2862_2_1
We went for a week, but did have to come back to town once.	hit:1431_conv:2862_3_305
Oh no, What happened?	hit:1431_conv:2862_4_1
Nothing bad.  We actually purchased a house to pick up and move, and they drove it down the road the week that we were on vacation.	hit:1431_conv:2862_5_305
I really love being in the great outdoors with my family!	hit:1435_conv:2870_1_305
Oh yea? Where are you guys? In the mountains? Camping?	hit:1435_conv:2870_2_1
We went camping, yes.  We're in the Midwest, so no mountains, unfortunately.  But we were near a lake.	hit:1435_conv:2870_3_305
Lakes are awesome. A body of water around here is pretty far. How long are you guys staying?	hit:1435_conv:2870_4_1
We were out there for a week.	hit:1435_conv:2870_5_305
I did well on a project for a company	hit:1455_conv:2911_1_111
Did you get anything extra, like a bonus or a trip.	hit:1455_conv:2911_2_40
I think I might get promoted based on the work	hit:1455_conv:2911_3_111
Great. What business is it?	hit:1455_conv:2911_4_40
I was on my way home when a car drove through a huge puddle near the sidewalk	hit:1458_conv:2916_1_111
I can tell where this is going.	hit:1458_conv:2916_2_262
I got completely drenched, it was terrible	hit:1458_conv:2916_3_111
That has never happened to me. Thank god!	hit:1458_conv:2916_4_262
I am a stay at home mom. School just started.	hit:1463_conv:2926_1_26
Well does that make you anxious?	hit:1463_conv:2926_2_225
It does, this is my only child and he is going to kindergarten.	hit:1463_conv:2926_3_26
Oh, that would be rough. I've been through that too.	hit:1463_conv:2926_4_225
How did you make it through?	hit:1463_conv:2926_5_26
A close friend of mine has to leave the state for work	hit:1482_conv:2965_1_111
Are you happy for him?	hit:1482_conv:2965_2_75
Kind of, it's going to be sad since I won't see him again most likely	hit:1482_conv:2965_3_111
But if is a great opportunity for him, you should be happy.	hit:1482_conv:2965_4_75
A friend was able to fix a problem I was having	hit:1491_conv:2983_1_111
That's very nice of the friend. What sort of problem was it?	hit:1491_conv:2983_2_209
Computer problem.  It was something I couldn't figure out on my own	hit:1491_conv:2983_3_111
Bah, those newfangled computers. It's nice to have a tech saavy friend.	hit:1491_conv:2983_4_209
My coworkers sometimes put more work on me than necessary.	hit:1514_conv:3029_1_318
Why do you think they do that?	hit:1514_conv:3029_2_220
They don't want to talk on the phone and can get away with it for a while.	hit:1514_conv:3029_3_318
That's not fair and probably very frustrating for you. You need to say something to them.	hit:1514_conv:3029_4_220
I agree, I'm actually up for a new position so if that happens they'll actually have to do work for a change.	hit:1514_conv:3029_5_318
I moved to tornado alley a few years ago. I'm not used to large tornadoes so I was pretty scared when it started storming.	hit:1543_conv:3087_1_61
Oh man, I can't even imagine. I lived in Kansas for a while and we had a storm that did a lot of damage. Took out the power all day and stuff. Nature can be so devastating sometimes.	hit:1543_conv:3087_2_303
We aren't too far south of Kansas in Oklahoma. We have had to spend a few evenings in the storm shelter. I guess stuff can be replaced. 	hit:1543_conv:3087_3_61
Jeeeze, yea, it's totally understandable to be afraid. Has it been good there otherwise?	hit:1543_conv:3087_4_303
I love it here, except for the tornadoes and snakes. 	hit:1543_conv:3087_5_61
It's awesome to hear that! I guess no place can ever be perfect though. Here's hoping we both can live long, happy, and fulfilling lives!	hit:1543_conv:3087_6_303
I can't believe I spent 2 hours in the car just to arrive to surf and no waves to be seen. 	hit:1561_conv:3122_1_60
That must be so disappointing. Is there something else you can do to have fun?	hit:1561_conv:3122_2_226
Kiteboard but I left half the gear at home. The surf report said 10 foot waves and it's flat water. Not cool bro, not cool	hit:1561_conv:3122_3_60
Sounds like you really like the water. So what do you do now?	hit:1561_conv:3122_4_226
Go to the surf bar I guess. 	hit:1561_conv:3122_5_60
In 6 days I leave for Peru	hit:1562_conv:3124_1_60
Wow! I've never been anywhere near there.	hit:1562_conv:3124_2_27
It's a surf trip. They have monster waves. I'm nervous. 	hit:1562_conv:3124_3_60
I've been to the ocean a few times but I've never even seen a surfer. We had a small boogie board.	hit:1562_conv:3124_4_27
Do you live inland? 	hit:1562_conv:3124_5_60
I live in Tennessee	hit:1562_conv:3124_6_27
I've been river surfing in Tennessee. You have some decent white water rivers that offer boating and also surfing.	hit:1562_conv:3124_7_60
Wow. I must have a boring life then, because I have only seen tug boats and barges on the Mississippi.	hit:1562_conv:3124_8_27
Every single morning one lady on my team comes into my office and cry's	hit:1564_conv:3128_1_60
Oh no! How come?	hit:1564_conv:3128_2_296
You guess is as good as mine. She's crazy. Today she was stressed. Mind you she is 22 lives at home and has no bills.	hit:1564_conv:3128_3_60
Oh well maybe she has a lot of problems internally. You never know how someone's home life is like.	hit:1564_conv:3128_4_296
She did mention this morning that her doctor said she needs meds or locked up. 	hit:1564_conv:3128_5_60
Aw well it's likely bipolar- I know a phew. They have a hard time even on meds. 	hit:1564_conv:3128_6_296
Yesterday before work she got in a fist fight with her equally crazy mother before work over salted peanuts. 	hit:1564_conv:3128_7_60
I can't decide how to spend the $100. I found next to my car this morning. 	hit:1568_conv:3137_1_60
I would save some and maybe get something you need/want?	hit:1568_conv:3137_2_296
Don't really need anything but it was a great way to start the day.	hit:1568_conv:3137_3_60
For sure! Any extra money is always good!	hit:1568_conv:3137_4_296
I'm thinking easy come easy go. Maybe do something fun this weekend I'm normally to broke to do.	hit:1568_conv:3137_5_60
I can't I went out with my ex's best friend while we were dating. I was a jerk but it was Karma biting her in the butt.	hit:1570_conv:3141_1_60
Had she done that to you before?	hit:1570_conv:3141_2_27
Right before that I found out she was seeing other people while I was in Iraq.	hit:1570_conv:3141_3_60
What a shame! 	hit:1570_conv:3141_4_27
Yea, it worked out for the best. A few months after that I meet my wife and we have been together for 11 years now. First baby is on the way in December. 	hit:1570_conv:3141_5_60
Congratulations!	hit:1570_conv:3141_6_27
Got on the scale this morning. Thanks to work stress I lost 15 pounds.	hit:1579_conv:3159_1_60
Oh man! I wish work stress would make me lose weight lol. I gain! Are you looking for a new job?	hit:1579_conv:3159_2_296
Yes, that or a new boss. I love my job but my boss is terrible.	hit:1579_conv:3159_3_60
Oh I don't deal with that well. I hope you get a new boss!	hit:1579_conv:3159_4_296
I give it to the end of the year. By that time I'll be slim thanks to all the weight I'll loose and then look for a new job. 	hit:1579_conv:3159_5_60
I can see the kid's car from here. He is 16 and has a car work 100k	hit:1588_conv:3176_1_60
Wow, what brand	hit:1588_conv:3176_2_126
Bmw 8 series. It's my neighbors kid. 	hit:1588_conv:3176_3_60
That is a nice car	hit:1588_conv:3176_4_126
Yea. I was his age in 2000. I drove a 30 year old rust bucket. 	hit:1588_conv:3176_5_60
Do you see a man and that yea he's got it going on?	hit:1592_conv:3184_1_60
Yeah all the time. I get so jealous	hit:1592_conv:3184_2_269
Yea well I lost 25 pounds and now i'm that guy. Happy in my skin. 	hit:1592_conv:3184_3_60
Wow, that is hard to do. Congratulations my dude!	hit:1592_conv:3184_4_269
Thanks. It was rough I love desert but no desert food for 6 months. 	hit:1592_conv:3184_5_60
Last time I climbed Elbert I started getting sick from altitude. Heading to Colorado next week to try to climb it again. 	hit:1599_conv:3199_1_60
That sounds awesome!  Is Elbert a fourteener?	hit:1599_conv:3199_2_294
Yes, it's the tallest in Colorado. This will be my 3rd time climbing it. But the first time since I got old and Lazy. 	hit:1599_conv:3199_3_60
Hahaha.  Well, I hope you don't get sick.  Take something salty with you, maybe that will help.  Have fun!	hit:1599_conv:3199_4_294
Last time I arrived and tried to climb it the same day. My head felt like it was going to explode.	hit:1599_conv:3199_5_60
Aced my Real Estate Exam today. Now I'm licensed in two states.	hit:1607_conv:3215_1_60

I'm self employed but new to the business.	hit:1607_conv:3215_5_60
Cool beans	hit:1607_conv:3215_6_27
I was recently waiting to hear from my old apartment about my security deposit refund. I needed the money to pay my new pet deposit, and wasn't sure if I'd get enough money back.	hit:1616_conv:3232_1_221
Were you able to get it back?	hit:1616_conv:3232_2_243
I was, and I ended up getting enough to pay the deposit and then some.	hit:1616_conv:3232_3_221
That's great! I bet that was a relief.	hit:1616_conv:3232_4_243
I was watching a video about a man who made a small table out of chocolate. It looked real and was just amazing. 	hit:1650_conv:3301_1_61
Wow, that should have been amazing	hit:1650_conv:3301_2_7
It really was. It also made me want to eat chocolate. 	hit:1650_conv:3301_3_61
Me too, I love chocolate	hit:1650_conv:3301_4_7
I was so happy to watch my friend do a backflip	hit:1679_conv:3359_1_259
I've always been too scared to do a backflip. I always worry I'm going to break my neck or something. Did it take him a long time to get it right?And did he get hurt?	hit:1679_conv:3359_2_273
I think he just took gymnastics classes. He luckily did not get hurt!	hit:1679_conv:3359_3_259
Oh, that makes sense. And I'm glad to hear that. I always worry about that sort of thing. You ever think about trying to do it netx?	hit:1679_conv:3359_4_273
I hope the next doctor's appt. that I have goes well. Sometimes they aren't the greatest experience. 	hit:1697_conv:3395_1_324
Are you sick?	hit:1697_conv:3395_2_4
Yeah, I have health problems, it's complicated. 	hit:1697_conv:3395_3_324
That sucks, I will pray for you.	hit:1697_conv:3395_4_4
Thank you, I appreciate you being kind. 	hit:1697_conv:3395_5_324
I can't believe I walked in on someone using the restroom. 	hit:1707_conv:3414_1_324
Oh my, that must've been an embarrassing situation!	hit:1707_conv:3414_2_182
It was! I knocked first and no one answered, so I thought it was okay to go in. 	hit:1707_conv:3414_3_324
That's ok, you did the right thing. It probably happens to lots of people.	hit:1707_conv:3414_4_182
Thanks, I'm sure it does haha	hit:1707_conv:3414_5_324
So remember I told you, that I've lost my phone for a moment on a subway?	hit:1712_conv:3425_1_326
Yes, what about it?	hit:1712_conv:3425_2_4
So i guess I just dropped it, and a very old man, picked it up and gave it back to me	hit:1712_conv:3425_3_326
That was nice of him.	hit:1712_conv:3425_4_4
I woke up today to a bit of a strange sight.	hit:1717_conv:3434_1_326
Tell me all about it.	hit:1717_conv:3434_2_9
Well, it was still dark and too early, but I felt like I had enough sleep.	hit:1717_conv:3434_3_326
I try to always go for extra sleep.	hit:1717_conv:3434_4_9
The party that was thrown for me was for my 30th. I think it made friends and family just as happy as it made me.	hit:1719_conv:3439_1_324
Wow! 30th is a big milestone birthday! I can imagine that everyone was excited to get to share that with you.	hit:1719_conv:3439_2_266
Thank you! I was glad to share that moment with them.	hit:1719_conv:3439_3_324
Did you feel old after?	hit:1719_conv:3439_4_266
Haha, not really. I feel older now. 	hit:1719_conv:3439_5_324
i was frustrated because i could not print a document, and a co worker showed me a keyboard shortcut to find it everytime.	hit:1735_conv:3470_1_327
That had to be relief. So now you won't have to deal with that frustration again.	hit:1735_conv:3470_2_226
Yes indeed, it was frustrating!  I didn't have time to mess with it everytime i had to print something.	hit:1735_conv:3470_3_327
Those keyboard shortcuts can be lifesavers.	hit:1735_conv:3470_4_226
Yes they can. I have become much more productive as a result.	hit:1735_conv:3470_5_327
Some things have changed in my life and my close friends have family have helped me through, which I really appreciate.	hit:1755_conv:3510_1_324
Thats good. Everyone isnt so fortunate.	hit:1755_conv:3510_2_262
For sure, thank you. Times can change very unexpectedly. 	hit:1755_conv:3510_3_324
Its goof to have support when it does change.	hit:1755_conv:3510_4_262
Definitely, I think we all need to support each other better in this world. 	hit:1755_conv:3510_5_324
Exactly	hit:1755_conv:3510_6_262
Hopefully we can find some kindness in the world and get the support we all need. 	hit:1755_conv:3510_7_324
We would all be better people then	hit:1755_conv:3510_8_262
One day I randomly got a raise, not something I was expecting!	hit:1764_conv:3529_1_324
oh wow. Bet it felt amazing. was it a mistake?	hit:1764_conv:3529_2_70
Thanks! It wasn't a mistake. Just unexpected and pretty neat!	hit:1764_conv:3529_3_324
sounds like a great day. makes you wish it would happen everyday	hit:1764_conv:3529_4_70
I definitely wish that could happen!	hit:1764_conv:3529_5_324
I was at the store and accidentally knocked over some items. I could feel my face turning red.	hit:1767_conv:3535_1_324
That's so embarrassing! What did you do?	hit:1767_conv:3535_2_196
I picked them up and tried to move to another area!	hit:1767_conv:3535_3_324
Did anyone say anything?	hit:1767_conv:3535_4_196
I don't think so. I seem to do these things quite often.	hit:1767_conv:3535_5_324
Well at least you got away with it this time!	hit:1767_conv:3535_6_196
Haha, I think as long as I put them back, no one minds.	hit:1767_conv:3535_7_324
I was flying alone, even though I had before, this particular time I felt wary.	hit:1769_conv:3539_1_324
Really? Why was that?	hit:1769_conv:3539_2_196
I think I felt concerned that the plane would crash or that something else bad might happen. 	hit:1769_conv:3539_3_324
Do you normally feel like that when you fly?	hit:1769_conv:3539_4_196
I do sometimes, but this time it was even more so.	hit:1769_conv:3539_5_324
I was traveling on a plane by myself and I felt kind of scared.	hit:1776_conv:3552_1_324
I can understand that, flying is scary.	hit:1776_conv:3552_2_322
It is. We ended up going through a thunderstorm.	hit:1776_conv:3552_3_324
I'm glad you didn't get hurt.	hit:1776_conv:3552_4_322
Thank you! There was a lot of turbulence, so that was not fun.	hit:1776_conv:3552_5_324
Hello!	hit:1803_conv:3606_1_242
Hey, do you have anything on your mind?	hit:1803_conv:3606_2_59
Yeah! i just received an email from guild wars 2 customer support, I lost my game code so i couldnt recover my account (forgot password), and they sent an email back asking me for the code. its so surprising having to deal with people this stupid, you would think that they would never get hired to begin with	hit:1803_conv:3606_3_242
I agree, incompetent customer support is one of the worst things when dealing with such problems.	hit:1803_conv:3606_4_59
its so surprising though, They were hired to do ONE thing, and then they fail at that one thing, how did you get hired D: online stores have a similar problem with indians - I have nothing against them but the people online stores elect to hire are ones who cant speak english which results in your problem never getting solved cause they dont understand you. 	hit:1803_conv:3606_5_242
I recently lost my dog, after 13 years.	hit:1813_conv:3626_1_339
oh I am so sorry for your loss.	hit:1813_conv:3626_2_248
Yeah, it was terrible.  Heart wrenching to bury him.	hit:1813_conv:3626_3_339
I bet. You gave him a good long life, that was the best you could do.	hit:1813_conv:3626_4_248
When a spot came open for a supervisor job at my employer, that was a stressful week for me.	hit:1825_conv:3650_1_340
I am sorry it was so stressful	hit:1825_conv:3650_2_126
They had many qualified candidates and it took a full week for them to make their decision.	hit:1825_conv:3650_3_340
Just hope for the best	hit:1825_conv:3650_4_126
I had to work the day that my boyfriend and his family went to a Christmas party.	hit:1830_conv:3660_1_13
ugh thats the worst right.. everyone should have holidays off. 	hit:1830_conv:3660_2_11
It wasn't even a holiday, just on a Saturday during the day because the drive was so long.	hit:1830_conv:3660_3_13
I say skip work next time :p go for it 	hit:1830_conv:3660_4_11
When my daughter was a baby she couldn't talk so I taught her sign language.	hit:1849_conv:3698_1_13
i just love that, my son knows ASL	hit:1849_conv:3698_2_271
That's great! I taught her a few words that were interesting to her so she could tell us what she needed.	hit:1849_conv:3698_3_13
i wish schools would teach kids asl 	hit:1849_conv:3698_4_271
Yeah, me too that would be nice for them to learn.	hit:1849_conv:3698_5_13
My sister in law planned a get together during a time we couldn't go.	hit:1851_conv:3703_1_13
she wants to spend time with you	hit:1851_conv:3703_2_271
Well no, she knew we couldn't go out late because of my son's bedtime and scheduled it anyway.	hit:1851_conv:3703_3_13
that was nice of her	hit:1851_conv:3703_4_271
My mother in law wanted to take my daughter to Colorado, but she is only 3.	hit:1854_conv:3709_1_13
its a beautiful place	hit:1854_conv:3709_2_271
I'm sure it is, but she is very young and still looks for me in the morning.	hit:1854_conv:3709_3_13
in that case i agree then	hit:1854_conv:3709_4_271
We were going on vacation and I made a list of everything we could possibly need when we were there.	hit:1858_conv:3717_1_13
Where are you going on vacation?	hit:1858_conv:3717_2_10
We went to New Jersey, so a long way for us. We had a toddler, so I had to make sure I had everything for her.	hit:1858_conv:3717_3_13
That is close for me, but it is a fun time!	hit:1858_conv:3717_4_10
I seem to be always alert, so that even something loud happens, I remain calm.	hit:1862_conv:3725_1_326
i admire that 	hit:1862_conv:3725_2_271
I just wander, is this normal?	hit:1862_conv:3725_3_326
no its not	hit:1862_conv:3725_4_271

Keep a positive mindset and your anxieties will be relieved! 	hit:1868_conv:3737_4_59
I hope so.Thank you for youre support.	hit:1868_conv:3737_5_255
I was having my second baby and my friends threw me a baby shower without me knowing.	hit:1869_conv:3739_1_13
Oh my, you must have very surprised! 	hit:1869_conv:3739_2_59

It must have been an enjoyable day. You have nice friends!	hit:1869_conv:3739_4_59
I couldn't sleep on Christmas eve. I was ready to see my daughter's face when she woke up in the morning.	hit:1904_conv:3809_1_13
i bet she was so excited!! Did she love her presents?	hit:1904_conv:3809_2_52
Yeah she did, but I guess I was looking forward to it more than she was.	hit:1904_conv:3809_3_13
that was me last christmas lol my son was only 9 months old but i bought so many presents and i was so excited to see his reaction	hit:1904_conv:3809_4_52
I really like my job. I'm worried that I will lose it.	hit:1911_conv:3823_1_347
Oh no. Why are you worried to lose it?	hit:1911_conv:3823_2_99
I don't have as much work to do as in the past and no one needs help with anything.	hit:1911_conv:3823_3_347
Oh no.. That is a bit scary. I wish the best for you!	hit:1911_conv:3823_4_99

I am, thank you for asking!	hit:1911_conv:3823_6_99
I ordered a pizza today, but it really wasn't a pleasant experience.	hit:1912_conv:3825_1_326
Oh no, why not?!	hit:1912_conv:3825_2_99
The guy that took my order was rude, but I understand, most people can't control themselves...	hit:1912_conv:3825_3_326
They really can't. It's still no excuse though.	hit:1912_conv:3825_4_99
I can't believe my friend wouldn't answer her phone when I waited over an hour for her to pick me up!	hit:1913_conv:3826_1_347
Oh that sucks...did she explain herself yet	hit:1913_conv:3826_2_119
No, she just completely blew me off. I found out she was out on a date instead and didn't tell me.	hit:1913_conv:3826_3_347
Sounds like you need a new friend or your own car...or both lol	hit:1913_conv:3826_4_119
My neighbor is the worst! He has a dog that he just keeps chained up in the backyard, and he rarely feeds it. Last week I saw it and he looks anorexic.	hit:1928_conv:3856_1_250
That's terrible.  Someone should call animal control on them.	hit:1928_conv:3856_2_310
I know, what kind of human being would do that to a poor dog! I'm going to call animal control soon.	hit:1928_conv:3856_3_250
I hope they do something to help that poor puppy.	hit:1928_conv:3856_4_310
i was so shocked by the behavior of my friends dog	hit:1938_conv:3876_1_355
what happened ? 	hit:1938_conv:3876_2_11
when i knocked on the door i felt the door was open and i thought as he is in home itself i felt i can go in but suddenly his dog jumped on me	hit:1938_conv:3876_3_355
did he end up biting you?? 	hit:1938_conv:3876_4_11
no he but he pushed me with his legs and body he was so strong	hit:1938_conv:3876_5_355
My dog got really sick and was coughing up blood last week. I didn't know what to do. I had a panic attack.	hit:1943_conv:3886_1_250
Oh no, that's terrible!  Are both you and your dog alright now?	hit:1943_conv:3886_2_254
Yes, I took him to the vet and got him the help he needed. The possibility of losing my best friend had me frightened!	hit:1943_conv:3886_3_250
Yes, that would have frightened me too.  I'm glad he's alright now.	hit:1943_conv:3886_4_254
Financially, things will turn around for my family soon!	hit:1946_conv:3892_1_339
I hope and wish so. In this tough economic climate many are finding it difficult to cope with financial responsibilities	hit:1946_conv:3892_2_155
Yes, and we had a layoff of five months.  I believe in a brighter day, though, so I know it will improve.	hit:1946_conv:3892_3_339
Being optimistic will help you alleviate much of your accumulated stress	hit:1946_conv:3892_4_155
I was in a check out lane for a while waiting when another cashier comes alone and takes the people in the back of the line.	hit:1948_conv:3897_1_13
that is literally the worst, the people should have atleast told you to go ahead  first! 	hit:1948_conv:3897_2_11
Oh I know. People just gladly go, but the cashiers should be taught to take the next person in line.	hit:1948_conv:3897_3_13
its really so rude. ugh im sorry 	hit:1948_conv:3897_4_11
I love hanging out with my dog in nature, it makes me feel good.	hit:1949_conv:3899_1_260
I love dogs too what breed do you have ?	hit:1949_conv:3899_2_237
I have a 4 yr old golden do you have any?	hit:1949_conv:3899_3_260
i have a german shepard	hit:1949_conv:3899_4_237
Awesome how old is he/she?	hit:1949_conv:3899_5_260
Where at I am in life, currently, is at peace with everything around me. It is a first for me, and it is simply amazing.	hit:1952_conv:3905_1_339
That's awesome.  What did it take for you to get there	hit:1952_conv:3905_2_119
A lot of years struggling, and finalizing realizing that the struggle is the normal part of it all.  Acceptance and steadfastness led to happiness, I guess.	hit:1952_conv:3905_3_339
Sounds like you've gotten smarter and more observant over the years	hit:1952_conv:3905_4_119
I once saw a dead possum in my garbage it smelled terrible lol.	hit:1956_conv:3912_1_260
Oh how gross! I don't like possums anyways 	hit:1956_conv:3912_2_99
Yeah me neither lol any wildlife where you live?	hit:1956_conv:3912_3_260
Just lizards and gators. I live in South Florida haha	hit:1956_conv:3912_4_99
Cool I lived there for 2 years, lizards were indeed everwhere.	hit:1956_conv:3912_5_260
Recently, I've been watching my son play a game called Fortnite. It blows my mind how good he is at such a fast game.	hit:1957_conv:3915_1_339
I have heard about that game.  I heard there was one guy that makes about $500,000 a month playing it on the streaming service Twitch.  Maybe your son should give it a try.	hit:1957_conv:3915_2_294
I have never heard of Twitch.  That is a lot of money, I could retire!	hit:1957_conv:3915_3_339
Twitch is just a place where people stream themselves playing video games.  I guess a lot of people really love watching good players.  Go ahead and retire now and get him started!	hit:1957_conv:3915_4_294
My friend got a promotion and moved to California last week. I always thought I would be the first one to get out of this dump.	hit:1959_conv:3918_1_250
I'm sorry your friend moved away. Sounds like me when I moved from Indiana to Florida. My friend was upset when I left too.	hit:1959_conv:3918_2_99
He doesn't deserve to live in luxury! He gets to chill on the beaches and I'm stuck out here in the dessert.	hit:1959_conv:3918_3_250
That is your friend, you should be happy for them! 	hit:1959_conv:3918_4_99
I'm excited to go to school full time again in the fall!	hit:1961_conv:3922_1_260
Aw I am happy for you! What do you go to school for?	hit:1961_conv:3922_2_99
Engineering its tough but I think its really cool.	hit:1961_conv:3922_3_260
That is great! Good luck to you!	hit:1961_conv:3922_4_99
Thanks, anything you're looking forward to in the near future?	hit:1961_conv:3922_5_260
Watching my first child being born changed my life forever.	hit:1962_conv:3924_1_339
I bet! I can't imagine what that must be like to see a bran new life.	hit:1962_conv:3924_2_234
It changed my whole outlook on everything.  I have never felt such happiness condensed in such a short period of time/	hit:1962_conv:3924_3_339
That's awesome :) I'm happy for you! Hopefully one day I will get to see that	hit:1962_conv:3924_4_234
I stay home with my five year old son. Sometimes I hear things come out of his mouth that I know he learned from me.	hit:1966_conv:3932_1_26
Hopefully the things coming out of his mouth are good things, right?	hit:1966_conv:3932_2_277
I wish, he sometimes says curse words.	hit:1966_conv:3932_3_26
Oh.  I recommend correcting that before it gets out of hand.  Good luck!	hit:1966_conv:3932_4_277
Thanks! I was shocked that he picked up on that, my little playback machine!	hit:1966_conv:3932_5_26
I've been watching movie a few hours ago, and still feel its effects.	hit:1967_conv:3935_1_326
What movie were you watching?	hit:1967_conv:3935_2_274
I think it was called Rampage. 	hit:1967_conv:3935_3_326
That is a great movie.	hit:1967_conv:3935_4_274
I had a great time hiking with my family and dog recently! Do you like nature?	hit:1971_conv:3942_1_260
I do.  It feels great to get out into nature doesn't it?	hit:1971_conv:3942_2_274
Yeah I always enjoy hiking in the mountains or just going to the beach.	hit:1971_conv:3942_3_260
The beach is my most favorite place to go.	hit:1971_conv:3942_4_274
I lived in South Florida for 2 years and the beach got old lol, but once I moved out I appreciated at a bit more.	hit:1971_conv:3942_5_260
When I moved to Texas I didn't know anyone but my boyfriend.	hit:1973_conv:3946_1_13
That sounds rough, were you able to get accustomed to Texas?	hit:1973_conv:3946_2_276
Yeah, but I had left all my family behind. I didn't know anyone here for quite some time.	hit:1973_conv:3946_3_13
I know what you mean, that happened to me when I left for college a few years ago.	hit:1973_conv:3946_4_276
We got a new girl in class yesterday and I bet my friends that I could get her number! Let's just say lunch was on them.	hit:1986_conv:3972_1_250
Wow that is really confident on your end. Are you going to do anything with the girl	hit:1986_conv:3972_2_182
Well that's the attitude you have when you look like Brad Pitt. Maybe take her out to the movies and try to get to second base.	hit:1986_conv:3972_3_250
That sounds exciting. Just make sure she is okay with it all before!	hit:1986_conv:3972_4_182
We were talking to my husband's grandma and she asked about the rain hitting us. I thought she was talking about the rain we got on the way to see her, but she wasn't.	hit:1988_conv:3977_1_13
What was she referring to then?	hit:1988_conv:3977_2_282
She was talking about the rain storms that hit earlier in the week, and asked if we were effected by them. 	hit:1988_conv:3977_3_13
I see.  Do you get a lot of storms in your location?	hit:1988_conv:3977_4_282
Not too much, but when she asked I said we did, but we were talking about two different things.	hit:1988_conv:3977_5_13
I always hate that when you are never on the right wavelength with someone during a conversation	hit:1988_conv:3977_6_282
"Yesterday we watched ""The Land Before Time"" in class. That movie brings back so many memories."	hit:1991_conv:3983_1_250
That movie is a classic! I loved it as a kid!	hit:1991_conv:3983_2_99
Yes, I remember we used to call one of my friends Petrie because he looked exactly like him.	hit:1991_conv:3983_3_250
Hahah! That is awesome!	hit:1991_conv:3983_4_99
My new hotel neighbors are very noisy. 	hit:2001_conv:4002_1_326
get them reported	hit:2001_conv:4002_2_237
I might just do it, thank you.	hit:2001_conv:4002_3_326
You are welcome, if you take your stand they will  behave	hit:2001_conv:4002_4_237
My son starts kindergarten next week, I am a stay at home mom. I want to get caught up on scrapbooking my pictures of him!	hit:2004_conv:4008_1_26
I bet you're both excited and nervous about it! I have two kids of my own and one will be starting in about a year while the other is going to fourth grade.	hit:2004_conv:4008_2_286
I had all these plans when I had my son, they didn't work out but I am wishing that this does!	hit:2004_conv:4008_3_26
I'm sure it will! I hope it all works out for you.	hit:2004_conv:4008_4_286
I hope so as well. I am a few years behind.	hit:2004_conv:4008_5_26
I recently discovered that there are plenty of like minded people around where I live.	hit:2007_conv:4015_1_326
That's always a good thing. It means you should get on great with your neighbors.	hit:2007_conv:4015_2_343
Yes, Just knowing that I'm not alone is such a great feeling.	hit:2007_conv:4015_3_326
Most of my neighbors are good, kind people too, so I know just what you mean.	hit:2007_conv:4015_4_343
i felt anxious during my work. the finance related work which gives me satisfaction	hit:2008_conv:4017_1_199
Why did you feel anxious?	hit:2008_conv:4017_2_244
i love my job. i eagerly awaited to achieve and go  as long as i want in my life. 	hit:2008_conv:4017_3_199
Hmm.. I'm a little confused.  Why were you anxious?	hit:2008_conv:4017_4_244
i am a workaholic person i want to achieve some more thing in my life. when i go to my work i feel active and energetic. 	hit:2008_conv:4017_5_199
We were eating ice cream last night and my son walked over to a police officer and started talking to him.	hit:2011_conv:4022_1_26
Well that's sweet. How did the policeman react?	hit:2011_conv:4022_2_286
He was so nice, he even volunteered to set up a meeting with the mayor and my son!	hit:2011_conv:4022_3_26
Oh wow! That's awesome! Your son sounds like he has a bright future!	hit:2011_conv:4022_4_286
He was so excited! My husband and I were happy the police officer was so nice.	hit:2011_conv:4022_5_26
My took me white water rafting with him last week. When we got to the river I started having second thoughts.	hit:2017_conv:4035_1_250
I've done that before. Getting over that initial fear is really hard. But it's fun once you do!	hit:2017_conv:4035_2_234
I know, but since it was my first time I didn't know how to act. My mind started to go blank and I started to sweat profusely. 	hit:2017_conv:4035_3_250
I understand completely. It's that initial anxiety. It's a scary thing to do!	hit:2017_conv:4035_4_234
I couldn't wait for my mom to finally get here from New Jersey. She would stay about a week and a half.	hit:2019_conv:4039_1_13
I bet you are pretty anxious and excited at the same time.	hit:2019_conv:4039_2_274
Yeah, she would be able to see the kids, and she hardly ever comes to visit.	hit:2019_conv:4039_3_13
its always nice when grandmas come visit.	hit:2019_conv:4039_4_274
Last week, my brother landed a 900 on his skateboard like Tony Hawk at a skating competition.	hit:2022_conv:4044_1_250
Oh wow, that sounds like it might be cool but I don't know what that looks like, what is the 900?	hit:2022_conv:4044_2_291
It's when you turn a skateboard 900 degrees while spinning in the air. It's very hard to do, so you can imagine the look on my face when I saw my brother do it.	hit:2022_conv:4044_3_250
Yea, how old is your brother?	hit:2022_conv:4044_4_291
We go camping a lot during the summer. My favorite piece of equipment is my hammock!	hit:2023_conv:4047_1_26
I love camping, and understand why a hammock is your favorite. They're so comfortable!	hit:2023_conv:4047_2_363
They are, I love to read a good book while hanging out in the hammock!	hit:2023_conv:4047_3_26
That sounds amazing, as long as you're not reading scary books about the woods!	hit:2023_conv:4047_4_363
I wouldn't do that! Just a good book, where I didn't have to think much!	hit:2023_conv:4047_5_26
I agree. Camping and hammocks are for relaxing and letting the mind be free. 	hit:2023_conv:4047_6_363
I really enjoy going to Disney because it makes me feel very nostalgic for my childhood. 	hit:2031_conv:4063_1_347
I've actually never gone there. What's it like?	hit:2031_conv:4063_2_286
It's pretty awesome! Lots to do for adults as well. I tend to go to Epcot quite often with my annual pass. We live right down the street. 	hit:2031_conv:4063_3_347
That's good to hear. I do plan on taking my kids in the future!	hit:2031_conv:4063_4_286
Absolutely do! Memories of going to Disney with my parents were some of my fondest. 	hit:2031_conv:4063_5_347
I was pretty shook up last year when Hurricane Irma came through Florida.	hit:2033_conv:4066_1_347
Do you live in Flordia? I have family down there and was really worried about them. 	hit:2033_conv:4066_2_258
Yes, I live in Orlando so I was lucky that it was central, but we were out of power for a few days. 	hit:2033_conv:4066_3_347
That was lucky. Losing power is bad, but at least that was it. Scary situation. 	hit:2033_conv:4066_4_258
I really feel good when my friends keep my secrets. (Or at least I think they do!)	hit:2035_conv:4071_1_347
What will happen if the secret is told?	hit:2035_conv:4071_2_291
Not much, I just value my privacy. Do you have secrets that you tell your friends?	hit:2035_conv:4071_3_347
Of course, I only tell them the best ones though!	hit:2035_conv:4071_4_291
My sister in law got upset when she was over and I was trying to talk to her about it.	hit:2036_conv:4073_1_13
Oh no, was she upset at you or about something else?	hit:2036_conv:4073_2_152
About something else and I wanted to talk to her and make her feel better.	hit:2036_conv:4073_3_13
Well that's really kind of you to help her like that. She's lucky to have you!	hit:2036_conv:4073_4_152
I was at a concert a few weeks ago with my son and he had to go to the bathroom.  There were so many people there, mostly adults, and they refused to move so we could make it to the family bathroom.	hit:2038_conv:4076_1_26
Ugh, people can be so rude. Was he able to go to the bathroom?	hit:2038_conv:4076_2_288
He was not, there were just too many people standing around not moving.	hit:2038_conv:4076_3_26
That's awful!! So what did you end up doing? Did he just have to pop a squat?	hit:2038_conv:4076_4_288
He actually had an accident, because I didn't tell him to just go. Mommy of the year.	hit:2038_conv:4076_5_26
I'm really hopeful that I'll land a new promotion at work. 	hit:2041_conv:4082_1_347
As long as you work hard and stay dedicated, I'm sure it will come!	hit:2041_conv:4082_2_286
I hope so! Hard work and dedication tend to pay off. 	hit:2041_conv:4082_3_347
Absolutely! And if you trust your boss, I'm sure he will do the right thing.	hit:2041_conv:4082_4_286
As we were driving on the highway we got caught in a big storm.	hit:2050_conv:4100_1_13
Thats scary.  Did you have to pull over?	hit:2050_conv:4100_2_244
No we kept driving but the rain was real bad and trucks were swerving.	hit:2050_conv:4100_3_13
I take it you made it out safe beacuse we're here chatting	hit:2050_conv:4100_4_244
My parents told me that we would be going on a cruise vacation at Christmas. I couldn't believe it!	hit:2053_conv:4106_1_347
That sounds like an awesome Christmas present!  I've actually thought about doing that with my girls now that they are older and not much they really need.  Where are you going?	hit:2053_conv:4106_2_56
We went on the cruise in February. It was a Disney cruise in the Bahamas! What a great experience.	hit:2053_conv:4106_3_347
I've ALWAYS wanted to go on a Disney cruise - it's probably my dream vacation. I'm so jealous!!!	hit:2053_conv:4106_4_56
I was so glad when I graduated college	hit:2060_conv:4120_1_259
That's such a great accomplishment and such a relief at the same time. What was your major?	hit:2060_conv:4120_2_347
Communications. It was a little tough but not engineering tough!	hit:2060_conv:4120_3_259
I totally get that. I majored in business but sometimes I wish I majored in engineering. I'm kind of glad I didn't though. It's hard!	hit:2060_conv:4120_4_347
My family is so supportive. They even flew out when my last dog passed away and spent some time with me to make me feel better. 	hit:2060_conv:4121_1_347
Aww, that is very nice of them. i just had to put mine down a few weeks ago.	hit:2060_conv:4121_2_259
I'm so sorry to hear that. What kind of breed was your dog? 	hit:2060_conv:4121_3_347
Border Collie. Yours?	hit:2060_conv:4121_4_259
Yorkshire Terrier. She was a sweetheart.	hit:2060_conv:4121_5_347
I was very scared when flying for the first time	hit:2061_conv:4122_1_259
I can imagine! Did you end up having a good flight?	hit:2061_conv:4122_2_26
I did. Luckily no turbulance!	hit:2061_conv:4122_3_259
That's good! Hopefully you had a nice seatmate too!	hit:2061_conv:4122_4_26
My son starts school soon, we had a fun day out but when we got home he was really bad.	hit:2061_conv:4123_1_26
Aww, was he scared?	hit:2061_conv:4123_2_259
I don't think so, I think he was just over the day and it was too much for him.	hit:2061_conv:4123_3_26
I can see that. School is a challenging time for a kid.	hit:2061_conv:4123_4_259
I have heard that. Just bummed me out for the day.	hit:2061_conv:4123_5_26
I was very ready going into my test	hit:2062_conv:4124_1_259
Always good to feel ready for something like that. What subject was it in?	hit:2062_conv:4124_2_209
Engingeering. It was really tough!	hit:2062_conv:4124_3_259
Man, I remember those days. My engineering exams were killer. Did you do well on it?	hit:2062_conv:4124_4_209
Anytime we take a trip, I normally save what some people consider trash.	hit:2069_conv:4139_1_26
Another man's trash is another man's treasure! What things do you save?	hit:2069_conv:4139_2_209
Just different things that I can scrapbook, mementos from my trip. 	hit:2069_conv:4139_3_26
I keep a scrapbook myself! I love collecting stamps. Got any trips planned this year?	hit:2069_conv:4139_4_209
My pants feel down when riding my bike	hit:2071_conv:4143_1_259
I'm so sorry that happened to you. How did you handle this situation?	hit:2071_conv:4143_2_77
I just pulled them up. it was just embarassing.	hit:2071_conv:4143_3_259
I hope no one saw that, it must've been terrible.	hit:2071_conv:4143_4_77
I was scared to go to school	hit:2073_conv:4147_1_259
How are you going to learn! Why are you afraid to go?	hit:2073_conv:4147_2_209
Just nervous about all the people	hit:2073_conv:4147_3_259
It ain't so bad. I'm sure you'll make a few new friends and everything will be just fine.	hit:2073_conv:4147_4_209
I was scared of going into the caves	hit:2077_conv:4154_1_259
Please describe what scared you about the caves.	hit:2077_conv:4154_2_368
Just the darkness.	hit:2077_conv:4154_3_259
That seems like a valid reason to be scared of going into the caves!	hit:2077_conv:4154_4_368
We live in a very high cost of living area but don't make a ton of money. 	hit:2079_conv:4159_1_26
Is there anyway you can move to somewhere more affordable?	hit:2079_conv:4159_2_220
I'm not sure, sometimes I wish I had what the other people around me had.	hit:2079_conv:4159_3_26
I do too but it's natural to get envious of others sometimes, don't put yourself down over it.	hit:2079_conv:4159_4_220
Sometimes people ask me to do a lot of other stuff when I already have a lot on my plate.	hit:2086_conv:4173_1_26
That must be so annoying. I get that sometimes too.	hit:2086_conv:4173_2_77
I feel like people don't care that I have stuff to do.	hit:2086_conv:4173_3_26
I'm sad to hear that, I'm sure there is someone who cars.	hit:2086_conv:4173_4_77
My son went to the best preschool. When I needed him to stay late, they always had space for him. 	hit:2091_conv:4182_1_26
That's good to hear that you care for your son so much. I am sure he will be quite an intelligent child going to the best of the best.	hit:2091_conv:4182_2_209
I hope so, it really helps to get your village when you have kids.	hit:2091_conv:4182_3_26
Yeah, my village helped with my son's preschool tuition as well. Strength in numbers and good neighbors!	hit:2091_conv:4182_4_209
I was so grossed out when I saw someone vomit	hit:2094_conv:4189_1_259
Oh yuck! Where did that happen?	hit:2094_conv:4189_2_220
At Fazolis. It was so gross.	hit:2094_conv:4189_3_259
During dinner? ACK!	hit:2094_conv:4189_4_220
hello	hit:2096_conv:4192_1_44
Can you tell me about your recent experience?	hit:2096_conv:4192_2_139
i couldnt believe it when i heard they are making even more new star wars movies	hit:2096_conv:4192_3_44
Yeah, I love Star Wars. I was sad when Han Solo died. He was my favorite character!	hit:2096_conv:4192_4_139
i agree it was very sad. i dont know what they will do with the new films	hit:2096_conv:4192_5_44
My husband went to go hang out with his guy friends leaving me all alone.	hit:2097_conv:4195_1_13
That would make me sad, did you let him go? 	hit:2097_conv:4195_2_152
Yeah, I mean I didn't want to tell him he couldn't. I just don't like being by myself.	hit:2097_conv:4195_3_13
I know how you feel, I'm sorry about that, at least he probably came back pretty quickly.	hit:2097_conv:4195_4_152
I felt upset when I forgot to ask my friend to dinner.	hit:2098_conv:4196_1_259
I'm sure they will understand. You can always have another dinner, that's the beauty of life!	hit:2098_conv:4196_2_347
That is true. Good way to look at things!	hit:2098_conv:4196_3_259
Where did you end up going?	hit:2098_conv:4196_4_347
Tomorrow's my last day of work. I can't believe it. I wish I had something lined up. 	hit:2098_conv:4197_1_347
Oh no, have you look at other options?	hit:2098_conv:4197_2_259
I have and tried negotiating with my old work. I have an interview next week with another company so I hope that goes well!	hit:2098_conv:4197_3_347
I really hope you get it!	hit:2098_conv:4197_4_259
I was so mad when some guy cut me off in traffic!	hit:2099_conv:4198_1_259
Oh no. Did you flip him off?	hit:2099_conv:4198_2_293
No, I remained calm, but I was very mad!	hit:2099_conv:4198_3_259
That was probably for the best anyway. People who drive like that are the worst, though.	hit:2099_conv:4198_4_293
i couldnt stand it when my neighbor was using power tools at 8 am on a saturday	hit:2101_conv:4202_1_44
Wow, that's super annoying! I understand wanting to get things done early, but that's not very respectful to neighbors.	hit:2101_conv:4202_2_347
nope, it was very frustrating, he lives next door too	hit:2101_conv:4202_3_44
Have you talked to him about it?	hit:2101_conv:4202_4_347
yes i did, he hasnt done it since	hit:2101_conv:4202_5_44
I'm pretty worried about what the future will hold. I lose my job tomorrow. Trying to keep my head up! 	hit:2101_conv:4203_1_347
are you getting laid off?	hit:2101_conv:4203_2_44
Yes, unfortunately. We are having a huge company layoff and being a remote employee didn't help my case. 	hit:2101_conv:4203_3_347
im sorry, i hope you're able to find an even better job immediately	hit:2101_conv:4203_4_44
I was really scared when Hurricane Irma came through Florida last year. It was a pretty horrible experience.	hit:2104_conv:4208_1_347
Do you live in Florida?	hit:2104_conv:4208_2_293
I do, in Orlando. I feel lucky to have had no damage to my home and been in a central location, but the storm was awful and we had no power for 4 days.	hit:2104_conv:4208_3_347
Wow, that sounds terrifying. You are very lucky to have made it out without any property damage though.	hit:2104_conv:4208_4_293
I work online to make extra money for things my family wants.	hit:2108_conv:4216_1_26
Thats amazing, you must be a good person	hit:2108_conv:4216_2_210
It's nice to be able to pay for fun things that our budget doesn't allow us to normally do.	hit:2108_conv:4216_3_26
How many kids do you have?	hit:2108_conv:4216_4_210
i felt bored being by myself all week	hit:2109_conv:4219_1_44
Sometimes i like to not have other people asking things of me. Alone can be good.	hit:2109_conv:4219_2_371
it was just boring because i had so much work to get done	hit:2109_conv:4219_3_44
Well at least you didn't have a lot of people under foot to slow you down. So I hope the sacrifice of being bored was worth it.	hit:2109_conv:4219_4_371
My son's school starts next week and they just changed the first day of school!	hit:2115_conv:4230_1_26
I am so sorry to hear that!	hit:2115_conv:4230_2_374
My husband had to ask off for a different day without much notice!	hit:2115_conv:4230_3_26
That is the worst. At least you and your husband got something worked out for your son's first day at school! 	hit:2115_conv:4230_4_374
I was looking through my cloud and found some pics of when I was little.	hit:2118_conv:4236_1_13
 A walk down memory lane.	hit:2118_conv:4236_2_159
Yeah, it makes me miss being at home and around my family.	hit:2118_conv:4236_3_13
Oh I bet! It's always good to cherish those memories.	hit:2118_conv:4236_4_159
I was watching my favorite tv show and my husband kept talking to me during it.	hit:2122_conv:4244_1_13
oh that can be annoying, did you tell him anything?	hit:2122_conv:4244_2_248
I just gave him a look. The thing is he says I do that instead of waiting til commercial, but then he goes and does it to me.	hit:2122_conv:4244_3_13
hahah that's kinda funny. Maybe he just missed you!	hit:2122_conv:4244_4_248
I was glad my dad asked me to go on a mission trip with him.	hit:2126_conv:4252_1_158
Nice! Where did you go?	hit:2126_conv:4252_2_239
Belize. He did doctor stuff. I didn't do much. But it was cool to see what they were up to.	hit:2126_conv:4252_3_158
Oh, that is really cool! What a great experience, and fun to bond with your dad!	hit:2126_conv:4252_4_239
i was upset sitting in traffic yesterday	hit:2129_conv:4258_1_44
Was it long?	hit:2129_conv:4258_2_210
about an hour	hit:2129_conv:4258_3_44
That's long, I understand the reason behind you being upset 	hit:2129_conv:4258_4_210
My friends were finally coming over to visit, it had been a long time since I saw them last.	hit:2130_conv:4260_1_13
I know how you feel, it's always good to bond with your buddies when you can	hit:2130_conv:4260_2_237
Yeah, I really miss seeing them since they moved.	hit:2130_conv:4260_3_13
Thank God you will be able to tell them in person about how much you miss them	hit:2130_conv:4260_4_237
i have good memories when i see photos of my grandmother	hit:2133_conv:4267_1_44
Oh yea, I can relate to the good times, is she still alive?	hit:2133_conv:4267_2_210
no unfortunately she isnt	hit:2133_conv:4267_3_44
oh no. May her soul rest in peace	hit:2133_conv:4267_4_210
Well last week my husband and I celebrated our 10th wedding anniversary.	hit:2139_conv:4279_1_208
Congrats! I'm sure you will have great memories. 	hit:2139_conv:4279_2_379
We do.  10 years being loyal and true to each.  I just hope we have many more!	hit:2139_conv:4279_3_208
I believe you will just continue doing what you've already done.	hit:2139_conv:4279_4_379
thats true.  Are you married yet yourself?	hit:2139_conv:4279_5_208
Yes I am married	hit:2139_conv:4279_6_379
I hope you are as happy as I am.  Its nots easy though, a work in progress, but worth it all in the long run.	hit:2139_conv:4279_7_208
I am happy and yes its a lot of work. Anything worth having takes work to keep it.	hit:2139_conv:4279_8_379
I have a presentation tonight, I'm nervous but I still think I'll ace it.	hit:2189_conv:4378_1_260
HAve you been practicing? Do you have note cards?	hit:2189_conv:4378_2_27
I don't want to use note cards as I look better without them. I did use them while practicing though.	hit:2189_conv:4378_3_260
I hope you do well. IS it for school?	hit:2189_conv:4378_4_27
Thanks, yeah it is for a summer class in macroeconomics.	hit:2189_conv:4378_5_260
Well congratulation on your A in advance lol	hit:2189_conv:4378_6_27
Thanks I know ill get it lol.	hit:2189_conv:4378_7_260
A tarantula bit me in my living room the other day and I thought I was going to die.	hit:2193_conv:4387_1_250
Oh my gosh! Was it a wild tarantula or a pet?	hit:2193_conv:4387_2_17
It was a wild tarantula. I had my family rush me to the hospital, but I ended up being just fine. It only caused me discomfort for a couple of days.	hit:2193_conv:4387_3_250
Thank goodness! The biggest type of spider we have here if a wolf spider. They don't really bite you unless you irritate them.	hit:2193_conv:4387_4_17
Last week, my childhood friend came to visit from out of town. I couldn't stop smiling when we hung out.	hit:2199_conv:4399_1_250
Oh awesome! How are they doing?	hit:2199_conv:4399_2_296
Great. We were just cracking jokes the whole time. It was good to see him.	hit:2199_conv:4399_3_250
Awesome! It's nice to see people who knew you so long ago. No friendships like those!	hit:2199_conv:4399_4_296
Yesterday, my brother came out on the news because he was taking about the new charity he started. I'm glad I have brother with such a good heart.	hit:2205_conv:4410_1_250
Wow, that's really great. What charity did he donate to?	hit:2205_conv:4410_2_360
No, he's starting his own. I'm glad I'm able to call him my bro.	hit:2205_conv:4410_3_250
Oh, sorry. That's awesome. What does his charity support?	hit:2205_conv:4410_4_360
My daughter wanted to go outside and play so I sat out there with her.	hit:2207_conv:4414_1_13
Was the weather nice?	hit:2207_conv:4414_2_27
Yes it was nice outside. I felt very relaxed out there.	hit:2207_conv:4414_3_13
I can't wait until we get nice weather. ITs too hot to do anything	hit:2207_conv:4414_4_27
I was in a long line at the supermarket the other day. Then some lady just cut right in front of me like nothing.	hit:2230_conv:4461_1_250
Some people have no concept of being rude.	hit:2230_conv:4461_2_225
It mad me sick! Do they teach these people about manners?	hit:2230_conv:4461_3_250
no, they dont.	hit:2230_conv:4461_4_225
I was diagnosed with stage four cancer yesterday. The doctor told me I have less than a month to live.	hit:2238_conv:4477_1_250
Are you serious? That is extremely terrible news to hear. :( 	hit:2238_conv:4477_2_11
Yes, I fell to my knees when I heard the news and haven't stopped crying since. My life is pretty much over!	hit:2238_conv:4477_3_250
I really wish I knew what to say, but even watching my mother go thru stage 4 I still dont know what to say! Spend a lot of time with your loved ones! 	hit:2238_conv:4477_4_11
When my daughter was a baby she picked up sign language really well.	hit:2266_conv:4533_1_13
Really, isn't that unusual?	hit:2266_conv:4533_2_225
Not really, I was trying to teach her so she could communicate with us and tell us what she wanted.	hit:2266_conv:4533_3_13
I'm glad it worked out so well for you all .	hit:2266_conv:4533_4_225
Yesterday, I was at the doctors office all day waiting for my blood tests. I was hoping everything would turn out alright.	hit:2273_conv:4547_1_250
I know how stressful that can be. I hope everything turned out alright.	hit:2273_conv:4547_2_243
The wait turned out to be worth it because the results showed that everthing was fine.	hit:2273_conv:4547_3_250
That is great news!	hit:2273_conv:4547_4_243
I was so annoyed earlier - went back to get my car after doing my shopping and someone had hit it and driven off!	hit:2274_conv:4549_1_208
That wasn't nice. I hope they caught them.	hit:2274_conv:4549_2_4
No unfortunately not.  There were no cameras in the carpark and no one saw anything.  So i am left with the bill.  I hope karma gets them eventually though.	hit:2274_conv:4549_3_208
That sucks, how much is it?	hit:2274_conv:4549_4_4
Not sure yet, I have left it into garage to get priced up but its looks pretty bad. 	hit:2274_conv:4549_5_208
I was applying for a manager position at the store I worked at. I felt really sure about the interview.	hit:2279_conv:4558_1_13
I can relate. You just have to be yourself.  Do you know if you got the job?	hit:2279_conv:4558_2_267
Yeah they offered me the job. I was very excited.	hit:2279_conv:4558_3_13
That’s great!  How do you like it?	hit:2279_conv:4558_4_267
i am really happy about the weather today	hit:2282_conv:4564_1_44
Is it sunny where you are ?	hit:2282_conv:4564_2_225
yes and warm but not too hot	hit:2282_conv:4564_3_44
Glad for you, it's cloudy and humid here.	hit:2282_conv:4564_4_225
that is unfortunate	hit:2282_conv:4564_5_44
My friends girlfriend kissed me at a party last week. It's been weighing heavy on my mind. Should I tell him?	hit:2283_conv:4567_1_250
Why did you wait a week? Tell her to tell him	hit:2283_conv:4567_2_262
But, he's been my best friend since childhood. I think I should be the one to tell him. I just feel so bad. That's why I postponed it.	hit:2283_conv:4567_3_250
I don't know. You should have told hime when it happended. Just do it and get uit out of the way so you both can move past it.	hit:2283_conv:4567_4_262
i got a letter from my grandmother in the mail today	hit:2284_conv:4569_1_44
That's nice. I always like getting letters.	hit:2284_conv:4569_2_225
did you ever have a pen pal when you were a child?	hit:2284_conv:4569_3_44
no, I never did. It might have been nice.	hit:2284_conv:4569_4_225
My friend won 58 million when he hit the jackpot the other day. I don't understand, why cant good stuff like that happen to me?	hit:2285_conv:4571_1_250
58 million. That's unbelievable.	hit:2285_conv:4571_2_262
I couldn't believe he won it because he's so stingy and I'm such a kind hearted person. I deserve it more!	hit:2285_conv:4571_3_250
Well, you know how to get it from  him right?	hit:2285_conv:4571_4_262
Yesterday, I went engagement ring shopping and I picked out the perfect ring for my wife. 	hit:2296_conv:4593_1_250
ah congratulations on the engagement! How long have you two been together?	hit:2296_conv:4593_2_1
Thanks buddy. We have been dating for 2 years on and off. I can't wait to show her the ring. I like it a lot and I think she will too.	hit:2296_conv:4593_3_250
No problem. I hope she'll love it as well.	hit:2296_conv:4593_4_1
I was upset when my friend forgot to invite me to dinner	hit:2299_conv:4598_1_259
Oh no. Did you guys talk about it?	hit:2299_conv:4598_2_1
We did. He apologized, but I just hate that he forgot me.	hit:2299_conv:4598_3_259
No one's perfect. I hope you won't hold a grudge.	hit:2299_conv:4598_4_1
I had a major work presentation to give	hit:2305_conv:4610_1_111
How'd it go?	hit:2305_conv:4610_2_1
It went well, I felt like I had everything in order	hit:2305_conv:4610_3_111
Being prepared pays off soemtimes.	hit:2305_conv:4610_4_1
I took a work related placement test for a better position in my company	hit:2318_conv:4637_1_111
how did you do on it?	hit:2318_conv:4637_2_10
I did well overall, it was easier than I thought	hit:2318_conv:4637_3_111
Good, well I hope you get the better position!	hit:2318_conv:4637_4_10
Just started my budget. Apparently I'm going to be ok. 	hit:2321_conv:4642_1_60
How strict is the budget?	hit:2321_conv:4642_2_10
Down the last dollar. I have a baby on the way so we've got to bank money	hit:2321_conv:4642_3_60
Ah, that makes sense, well I hope it goes well for you!	hit:2321_conv:4642_4_10
Thank's Im hopeful that we will be able to stick to it. 	hit:2321_conv:4642_5_60
i was impressed by my nephews performance at his little league baseball game	hit:2324_conv:4648_1_44
Nice. Did his team finish first?	hit:2324_conv:4648_2_7
they won the game and he played really well	hit:2324_conv:4648_3_44
At his age, they progress very quickly	hit:2324_conv:4648_4_7
i really appreciated all the effort my friends put into my birthday	hit:2351_conv:4702_1_44
That's very nice of them! Having caring friends is very important.	hit:2351_conv:4702_2_20
yes it is	hit:2351_conv:4702_3_44
What did they do for you?	hit:2351_conv:4702_4_20
I'm over the road trucker. Man it gets boring in the evenings. 	hit:2353_conv:4707_1_60
I bet it does, you should find a podcast you like	hit:2353_conv:4707_2_10
I listen to most of those as I drive. I was thinking of getting into gaming. I have a Tv in the truck and can buy a game system. 	hit:2353_conv:4707_3_60
That is smart, I would recommend a nintendo switch!	hit:2353_conv:4707_4_10
Someone told me that on the CB. But I've never heard of it before earlier today. I've got to do something. The boredom is dragging me down.	hit:2353_conv:4707_5_60
I see a lot of work coming up at my job	hit:2354_conv:4708_1_111
How so?	hit:2354_conv:4708_2_259
My supervisor warned me earlier in the week about it	hit:2354_conv:4708_3_111
I'm sorry. Any way you can get out of it?	hit:2354_conv:4708_4_259
I was scared to fly for the first time	hit:2354_conv:4709_1_259
Why's that?	hit:2354_conv:4709_2_111
Because I am scared of heights.	hit:2354_conv:4709_3_259
Have you always been scared of heights?	hit:2354_conv:4709_4_111
i couldnt believe it rained this afternoon after such a sunny morning	hit:2355_conv:4710_1_44
Yuck!  You didn't get wet and muddy I hope!	hit:2355_conv:4710_2_277
nope it only rained for a few minutes	hit:2355_conv:4710_3_44
That is good to hear.  No one likes soggy shoes!	hit:2355_conv:4710_4_277
I was really proud of my friend for doing a backflip	hit:2359_conv:4719_1_259
Backflips are scary. Neck injury is serious.	hit:2359_conv:4719_2_231
Yes, but luckily he completed it without hurting anything.	hit:2359_conv:4719_3_259
Thats good! They do look cool too.	hit:2359_conv:4719_4_231
I was scared to fly for the first time	hit:2361_conv:4723_1_259
I was scared the first and only time I flew also. Where were you flying to?	hit:2361_conv:4723_2_228
Europe. So a long flight!	hit:2361_conv:4723_3_259
Oh wow! I bet that was really exciting. I have never been out of the country.	hit:2361_conv:4723_4_228
I feel bad for forgetting about my mom's birthday	hit:2363_conv:4726_1_259
You must feel horrible!  Get her something extra nice and I am sure she will forgive you!	hit:2363_conv:4726_2_277
What should I get her?	hit:2363_conv:4726_3_259
Get her flowers and a gift certificate to a nice massage place!	hit:2363_conv:4726_4_277
I was thinking about how I missed my grandma	hit:2364_conv:4728_1_259
I have the same feeling. I miss her also	hit:2364_conv:4728_2_7
She passed last year. She is in a better place.	hit:2364_conv:4728_3_259
Sorry to hear that	hit:2364_conv:4728_4_7
I have a work project coming up that needs to be completed	hit:2366_conv:4732_1_111
Are you going to have it completed in time?  I hope you are not behind schedule!	hit:2366_conv:4732_2_277
I still have much to be done	hit:2366_conv:4732_3_111
Ouch!  You better knuckle down and burn the midnight oil!	hit:2366_conv:4732_4_277
So I walked into work this morning. I have a new boss. He's 20 and had a PhD. I'm amazed.	hit:2374_conv:4749_1_60
Wow! I would be amazed too!	hit:2374_conv:4749_2_27
A little worried. While super smart as we get older we gain real world experience in dealing with people that you can not learn in a book. But still at 20 I was struggling with my associates degree. 	hit:2374_conv:4749_3_60
That's so true. Im 30 and just now having the time to work on my bachelors. But I have a lot of work experience.	hit:2374_conv:4749_4_27
I'm 34 and still working on the BA as well. When life got in the way education had to take a back seat.	hit:2374_conv:4749_5_60
Same here. Well I hope he can adapt and do well. Good luck with your BA too!	hit:2374_conv:4749_6_27
So ever single day my boss is late to work. 20 minutes or more. Today I was 1 minute late, first time in 2 years and I got a wrote up.	hit:2389_conv:4779_1_60
Wow. That's pretty hypocritical.	hit:2389_conv:4779_2_1
Yea, I even called and let them know the highway was closed down and I was going to be late. I even text her photo of the traffic accident once I got up to it.	hit:2389_conv:4779_3_60
I think she's just trying to cause a problem.	hit:2389_conv:4779_4_1
I was hungry and took my co-workers food	hit:2391_conv:4783_1_111
Did you not have your own food?	hit:2391_conv:4783_2_388
I didn't have any that day, I was also out of money	hit:2391_conv:4783_3_111
Oh no! That sounds horrible! Did the co-worker find out?	hit:2391_conv:4783_4_388
This morning I don't know what got into me but on the way to work I picked up a homeless guy. 	hit:2394_conv:4789_1_60
Oh wow. Give me the details.	hit:2394_conv:4789_2_262
Yea, as I pulled over I thought it was someone down on his luck. Nope, he was crazy.	hit:2394_conv:4789_3_60
Are you missing an organs?	hit:2394_conv:4789_4_262
Haha, it started off ok. He was going to the train station. I agreed to take him. With in minutes he was talking to him self. 	hit:2394_conv:4789_5_60
Well, At least you're in one piece. you could have been in several.	hit:2394_conv:4789_6_262
Went on a first date last weekend. Had some sort of BBQ appetizer early in the date. Yummy, yea well not really! 	hit:2407_conv:4814_1_60
Not really? How come?	hit:2407_conv:4814_2_1
Well, after about an hour I got up to pee. As I washed my hands I looked up and my face was covered with sauce. It looked like someone poured it on my face, 	hit:2407_conv:4814_3_60
Oh wow, the BBQ must be delicious.	hit:2407_conv:4814_4_1
yea, I will not see here again but I will be seeing the BBQ again this weekend. 	hit:2407_conv:4814_5_60
Do you ever wake up and realize how lucky we are? I travel a lot and I just got back from Haiti. I'm convinced it's better to be poor in America then rich in Haiti.	hit:2408_conv:4816_1_60
"That's a profound thought. We definitely take America for granted, especially when some people say it's in its ""worst state in a long time."" We're prisoners of the moment."	hit:2408_conv:4816_2_273
Those that criticize have not traveled the real world out side resort gates or into the third world. Then you see a real state that is in trouble.	hit:2408_conv:4816_3_60
Yeah, I guess you would know for sure, since you've seen it first hand. Especially a place like Haiti, that's just gets pounded with hurricanes. What brought you to Haiti, if you don't mind me asking?	hit:2408_conv:4816_4_273
I travel a lot. My self and my wife try to see 2-3 new cultures a year. 	hit:2408_conv:4816_5_60
Monday I was downtown for work. I was on my way home when a homeless man asked form some money. I went to reach for my wallet and it was gone.	hit:2413_conv:4826_1_60
I am sorry to hear that.Is there a chance you forgot your wallet home?	hit:2413_conv:4826_2_75
No it was stolen. So when I went to reach for it. The homeless man could tell something was wrong. He actually paid for my train ticket home. I end up seeing him again today. Took him out to lunch and gave him some money.	hit:2413_conv:4826_3_60
That story could become a movie script.	hit:2413_conv:4826_4_75
I really want to help him get his life together. 	hit:2413_conv:4826_5_60
All I want in life this weekend is to sleep and I have to work. 	hit:2420_conv:4840_1_60
That’s a bummer. Drink some coffee	hit:2420_conv:4840_2_267
Coffee dose even phase me anymore. The lack of sleep is making my soul sad.	hit:2420_conv:4840_3_60
Try drinking a lot of water and cutting out soda	hit:2420_conv:4840_4_267
I'll try that. 	hit:2420_conv:4840_5_60
This weekend was supposed to be my first weekend off in 2 months. 	hit:2428_conv:4857_1_60
Is it not going to happen?	hit:2428_conv:4857_2_27
Nope, my boss who only works one weekend a month has decided this month she is not going to work any weekends.	hit:2428_conv:4857_3_60
That sucks. 	hit:2428_conv:4857_4_27
Yea, she is not a very good boss and now I'm super bummed. 	hit:2428_conv:4857_5_60
You should find another job. No use being miserable. Or tell her boss!	hit:2428_conv:4857_6_27
I recently took my ELS certification test. I studied really hard, so I'm sure I passed it.	hit:2456_conv:4912_1_221
What's ELS?	hit:2456_conv:4912_2_269
Sorry, ESL. It's English as a Second Language. It just means I am certified to teach students that don't speak fluent English.	hit:2456_conv:4912_3_221
Ah, gotcha. A few of my friends teach English to Chinese students online and I think they have taken ESL courses	hit:2456_conv:4912_4_269
I just moved into my new house and I am having a cockroach problem.	hit:2460_conv:4920_1_221
That really sucks! What do you have to do?	hit:2460_conv:4920_2_267
I'm just using Raid right now, but I will call an exterminator tomorrow. I hate bugs so I am freaking out a little bit.	hit:2460_conv:4920_3_221
I do too.  I am so sorry you are going through this	hit:2460_conv:4920_4_267
When I was in New York, I got to see STOMP. It was an amazing show.	hit:2464_conv:4929_1_221
Wow. I had that DVD.	hit:2464_conv:4929_2_27
I used to watch it in music class a lot. I am fascinated by the way they make music with everyday items.	hit:2464_conv:4929_3_221
I know. I wonder if they still do that show	hit:2464_conv:4929_4_27
This was just a few years ago, so hopefully.	hit:2464_conv:4929_5_221
I love my dad. He only made me pay half of the money I owed him and let me keep the rest for my pet deposit.	hit:2467_conv:4935_1_221
Some dads are cool like that. My mom is that way sometimes.	hit:2467_conv:4935_2_262
I was shocked. I was fully prepared to pay the full thing. He's great.	hit:2467_conv:4935_3_221
I just went on a trip with my mom and sh paid for almost everything	hit:2467_conv:4935_4_262
my bus broke down and i was late for work, again!	hit:2471_conv:4943_1_327
Are you a busdriver?	hit:2471_conv:4943_2_269
no i ride a bus to work. this has happened twice in the past month. i need to get a car	hit:2471_conv:4943_3_327
Ah, gotcha. I hate it when things happen out of our control. Hope you get it figured out	hit:2471_conv:4943_4_269
Hey there	hit:2482_conv:4964_1_391
Hi what you got going on?	hit:2482_conv:4964_2_267
Uhm.. just feeling blue. My gf broke up with me recently and got married to an investment banker	hit:2482_conv:4964_3_391
That is really sad.  Are you alright?	hit:2482_conv:4964_4_267
i guess so.. i mean, we were the same age. This guy was like 5-6 years elder, so ahead of me in life. i tried convincing her to give me a bit more time.. well.	hit:2482_conv:4964_5_391
I feel so bad that i failed my last semester exam	hit:2546_conv:5092_1_178
I'm sorry.  Will you be able to pass this semester/	hit:2546_conv:5092_2_322
I am doing my best to pass	hit:2546_conv:5092_3_178
I'm sure it will happen.	hit:2546_conv:5092_4_322
i will be presenting my project to the company and am tensed about it	hit:2547_conv:5094_1_178
I am sure you will do well!	hit:2547_conv:5094_2_322
Yes, i have prepared for two months now	hit:2547_conv:5094_3_178
I don't think you will need to worry then.	hit:2547_conv:5094_4_322
My best friend had arranged for my birthday party, but she did not attend, i feel so bad	hit:2562_conv:5124_1_178
Sorry to hear that. Why did they not attend?	hit:2562_conv:5124_2_366
he was at work 	hit:2562_conv:5124_3_178
Hopefully your friend can make it up to you and hang out with you some time soon.	hit:2562_conv:5124_4_366
my parents went on vacation and i am left aloe in the house	hit:2566_conv:5132_1_178
Ha, hope you aren't too scarred about being all by yourself.	hit:2566_conv:5132_2_328
i am scared, especially at night	hit:2566_conv:5132_3_178
Watching too many horror movies I bet. Just put on some comedy special.	hit:2566_conv:5132_4_328
Man I am so glad I was able to climb out of poverty.	hit:2570_conv:5141_1_132
That's quite an accomplishment. You must have worked very hard.	hit:2570_conv:5141_2_332
I was homeless for about a year.  It felt like every day I would just descened even further.  But I always held out hope that things would get better.	hit:2570_conv:5141_3_132
That must have been a very hard time. Your persistence led you to this success because you never gave up that hope.	hit:2570_conv:5141_4_332
Well there was a little luck in there as well.  I certainly feel a little blssed by my current situation.	hit:2570_conv:5141_5_132
I'm so pleased with myself right now.  I saved up enough money to make all of my car payments at once next month.	hit:2580_conv:5160_1_132
That's very good. It takes a disciplined person to save money	hit:2580_conv:5160_2_210
Heh, well I didn't exactly save money that mush.  I just hunkered down and started working harder and asked for more hours.	hit:2580_conv:5160_3_132
You truely are determined to get that car, what brand is it?	hit:2580_conv:5160_4_210
It's a Kia Soul.  I hope to trade it in someday to cover the down payment on an electric car.	hit:2580_conv:5160_5_132
i am confident i am going to pass my exam	hit:2583_conv:5167_1_178
I hope you pass your exam. Did you do good at your exam?	hit:2583_conv:5167_2_7
yes, i always read hard	hit:2583_conv:5167_3_178
Good luck	hit:2583_conv:5167_4_7
Man I had an absolute blast from the past last week.	hit:2586_conv:5173_1_132
Really? What happened? 	hit:2586_conv:5173_2_392
I found my old elementary school.  I hear it was going to be torn down next month, so I toured the inside.	hit:2586_conv:5173_3_132
Wow, cool! Did they let you in? It's so cool you had that opportunity.	hit:2586_conv:5173_4_392
Yeah.  It was mostly abandoned anyway.  Memeories filled my head anyway and I found myself in the past again.	hit:2586_conv:5173_5_132
Yeah I went to a used car lot yesterday to check out a car I saw on the internet.  Not happy.	hit:2589_conv:5178_1_132
Ick. I've never heard of anyone having a really good experience with that.	hit:2589_conv:5178_2_234
Well I realzied that the owner had taken the pictures of the car from a large distance.  Up close it was very disappointing.	hit:2589_conv:5178_3_132
Ah, I see. The classic photo trick. I understand why you would be upset about that. That's definitly why it's so important to go see before you buy	hit:2589_conv:5178_4_234
Well I know I won't be buying anything from that place!	hit:2589_conv:5178_5_132
hi	hit:2590_conv:5180_1_199
Hi, tell me what's going on with you?	hit:2590_conv:5180_2_45
not going.hoe are u?	hit:2590_conv:5180_3_199
Oh, I'm well thank you.	hit:2590_conv:5180_4_45
its ok ya	hit:2590_conv:5180_5_199
Man I am so cheesed off today!	hit:2595_conv:5190_1_132
Oh really? Any reason why?	hit:2595_conv:5190_2_332
Yeah I was buying something in electronics and this guy shows up out of nowhere and starts criticizing my purchase!	hit:2595_conv:5190_3_132
Wow really? That's pretty rude and bad in general for an employee to be doing.	hit:2595_conv:5190_4_332
That's the thing!  It wasn't an employee, it was another customer!	hit:2595_conv:5190_5_132
You'll never guess what I saw on the road today.	hit:2598_conv:5196_1_132
Do tell	hit:2598_conv:5196_2_234
I saw a bear crossing the road a mile from my job.	hit:2598_conv:5196_3_132
That's neat! I've only seen ducks and chickens. A deer did bounce over my car once, though	hit:2598_conv:5196_4_234
Yet it really shocked me.  But he just ran off, so not much excitement.	hit:2598_conv:5196_5_132
Man I was so stoked to check my bank account today	hit:2605_conv:5211_1_132
I guess it didn't turn out well?	hit:2605_conv:5211_2_389
No man it was GREAT.  I finally got my first paycheck after my rasie!	hit:2605_conv:5211_3_132
oh.  SWEET!  Congrats!  What are you going to do with all that money??	hit:2605_conv:5211_4_389
Well I was gonna buy a few video games, but I'll of course set some aside.  No need to go crazy.	hit:2605_conv:5211_5_132
Save it for Spider-Man that comes out next month!  I can't wait for that	hit:2605_conv:5211_6_389
Thinking about it!  But  I may not have to, as by then I'll get another paycheck at this pay grade!	hit:2605_conv:5211_7_132
And more to come hopefully!  Don't forget to save for retirement and/or emergency fund :D	hit:2605_conv:5211_8_389
hi	hit:2621_conv:5243_1_199
Hello	hit:2621_conv:5243_2_329
how are you?	hit:2621_conv:5243_3_199
Am doing well thanks and you?	hit:2621_conv:5243_4_329
fine ya.thank you	hit:2621_conv:5243_5_199
hi	hit:2622_conv:5245_1_199
hi	hit:2622_conv:5245_2_45
how are you?	hit:2622_conv:5245_3_199
fine. But, I think you're suppose to do the prompts, so hope it doesn't cause you a rejection.	hit:2622_conv:5245_4_45
not for the rejections	hit:2622_conv:5245_5_199
hi	hit:2632_conv:5265_1_199
What have your experiences been like?	hit:2632_conv:5265_2_366
so nice my experience.	hit:2632_conv:5265_3_199
That's good to hear! Hope that it continues that way.	hit:2632_conv:5265_4_366
yes	hit:2632_conv:5265_5_199
I feel angry i have to pay with an interest	hit:2633_conv:5267_1_178
Oh I hate that. Is it a high interest rate?	hit:2633_conv:5267_2_332
yes, it is exorbitant just to say	hit:2633_conv:5267_3_178
It's highway robbery. Well I can only hope you can pay it quickly to avoid as much of that as possible.	hit:2633_conv:5267_4_332
One of my friends sent me a lot of money for my birthday right when I needed it a lot.	hit:2650_conv:5300_1_403
You read	hit:2650_conv:5300_2_210
I do read a lot of articles.	hit:2650_conv:5300_3_403
That's great , sorry for the error and unrelated message previously sent :) but you do have great friend that are dependable	hit:2650_conv:5300_4_210
Yes, he's one of my best friends and I really appreciated the help.  He's like a brother to me.  And it's okay about the error.	hit:2650_conv:5300_5_403
There was one time when I was in grade school and the fire alarm went off when I was in the bathroom.  I had a hard time buttoning my pants up and had to walk out holding them together in front of my classmates.	hit:2661_conv:5322_1_403
Oh my god, that must have been so embarrasing! Was there actually a fire?	hit:2661_conv:5322_2_59
Nope, it turned out to be a fire drill.  Everyone was laughing at me.  It wasn't one of my prouder moments.	hit:2661_conv:5322_3_403
Its okay, at least now you can look back at it as a funny moment.	hit:2661_conv:5322_4_59
I am sitting here and guessing when will the wi-fi stop working.	hit:2678_conv:5356_1_326
Oh no, I hate having connectivity problems! Are you having bad weather?	hit:2678_conv:5356_2_239
Yep its raining cats and dogs in here.	hit:2678_conv:5356_3_326
Oh, it has been raining here a lot too. I will keep my fingers crossed that your wi-fi keeps working!	hit:2678_conv:5356_4_239
Is anyone here?	hit:2681_conv:5362_1_406
Yes, I am here	hit:2681_conv:5362_2_49
Yes, I had fully charged it and after like 6-7 rides it had 3% left.	hit:2681_conv:5362_3_406
Oh no, I bet that was stressful. What did you do?	hit:2681_conv:5362_4_49
Well, I called the very last customer and made sure he only was traveling like 5-6 miles and that the system wouldn't die. It worked out.	hit:2681_conv:5362_5_406
Recently I've been enjoying being by myself.	hit:2682_conv:5365_1_326
I like my alone time too. What do you enjoy doing by yourself?	hit:2682_conv:5365_2_239
I just love people watch, if that's considered alone time.	hit:2682_conv:5365_3_326
Oh that's is fun. It's a way to be alone with your thoughts, but still be around others. I love to watch people! 	hit:2682_conv:5365_4_239
When I wake up and know that I am doing the things that I like, I feel great.	hit:2683_conv:5366_1_326
Yes I can related to that feeling	hit:2683_conv:5366_2_237
I don't think people realize iportance of that in their life.	hit:2683_conv:5366_3_326
Well, a great morning leads to a great day 	hit:2683_conv:5366_4_237
i watched a horror movie and i feel terrified and anxious all the time	hit:2686_conv:5373_1_178
Which movie did you watch?	hit:2686_conv:5373_2_217
lost 	hit:2686_conv:5373_3_178
That is a very scary movie! How are you coping?	hit:2686_conv:5373_4_217
It was really hurtful	hit:2687_conv:5374_1_406
What was hurtful may I ask?	hit:2687_conv:5374_2_59
Well, they made me leave everything at my desk, walked me downstairs, turn in my badge, and would mail my belonings.	hit:2687_conv:5374_3_406
That sounds like very bad treatment, You should sue them	hit:2687_conv:5374_4_59
Yah, I feel like it. Thanks for understanding.	hit:2687_conv:5374_5_406
I feel very strange for not feeling any remorse about anything really.	hit:2688_conv:5377_1_326
Maybe you haven't done anything terribly wrong that anyone would feel remorseful about. Do you think that's it?	hit:2688_conv:5377_2_239
I think it might just be a stage in life.	hit:2688_conv:5377_3_326
Maybe. It's none of my business but sometimes when people feel this way, they could be experiencing depression. 	hit:2688_conv:5377_4_239
Is it terribleto always feel ok, and not wait for the bad times	hit:2691_conv:5383_1_326
I suppose it is.	hit:2691_conv:5383_2_217
Than I will go on feeling this way I guess, or do I have another option?	hit:2691_conv:5383_3_326
You always have options!	hit:2691_conv:5383_4_217
She was actually always blind-sinding nice to my face and back-stabbing the other.	hit:2693_conv:5387_1_406
Sounds like someone who is actually not a friend. How long have you known her?	hit:2693_conv:5387_2_407
I have known her less than a year.	hit:2693_conv:5387_3_406
I used to work with a girl like that. She always talked bad about me but was nice to my face.	hit:2693_conv:5387_4_407
Yah, I can't stand when that happens. Just so wrong.	hit:2693_conv:5387_5_406
Do you ever feel that now you have finally grasped what life really is..	hit:2695_conv:5390_1_326
I can't say that I really do. It's always a mystery in my mind.	hit:2695_conv:5390_2_332
Or is the sign of overconfidence, like they say, -  there are two types of bikes, those that were in an accident, and those that will be?	hit:2695_conv:5390_3_326
I believe I see it more as that type. No one can truly know.	hit:2695_conv:5390_4_332
Some markets have to be avoided, that is if you valued your sense of smell.	hit:2696_conv:5392_1_326
I know what you mean. Wednesdays there's this market I like to go to, but lately it just has so much rotten food	hit:2696_conv:5392_2_188
Yet there's still something about that imperfection, do you agree?	hit:2696_conv:5392_3_326
Totally. I still love to go have a look around	hit:2696_conv:5392_4_188
Don't you think that the only one really capable of bringing you down, is you?	hit:2698_conv:5397_1_326
Yes, it is partially true. What is the problem?	hit:2698_conv:5397_2_7
There aren't any, I am just drawing a conclusion from past experience. 	hit:2698_conv:5397_3_326
I understand.	hit:2698_conv:5397_4_7
Sometime all it take is one rude person to ruin your day.	hit:2699_conv:5399_1_326
That is very true. Did something bad happen to you?	hit:2699_conv:5399_2_217
Nothing major, but I am still learning how to deal with such behavior and always open for an advice. 	hit:2699_conv:5399_3_326
Generally just try to ignore it as best as you can. I'm good about just letting things roll off my back.	hit:2699_conv:5399_4_217
when i went for shopping i parked my car at a no parking zone which i am not aware , police approached the car and was about to tow it away	hit:2701_conv:5402_1_355
Oh no! Those can be difficult to spot sometimes.	hit:2701_conv:5402_2_409
yes exactly , but i also had my 4 6 month old 11 month old baby with me .	hit:2701_conv:5402_3_355
Wow. That must have been stressful. I have babies, too. Did they understand?	hit:2701_conv:5402_4_409
ya after they had seen my 11 month old baby with me they felt they should not trouble me by towing away car . i felt very thankful to them	hit:2701_conv:5402_5_355
That is a relief. Sounds like you made it just in time.	hit:2701_conv:5402_6_409
yes some people are very understanding and helpful	hit:2701_conv:5402_7_355
gosh ive been feeling so nervous for the past 24 hours, its almost like an impending sense of doom, To my knowledge theres nothing about to go wrong or blow up in my face but it feels like something is going badly	hit:2704_conv:5409_1_242
I get it. Sometimes I feel stressed out for no real reason myself.	hit:2704_conv:5409_2_217
i ordered some semi expensive tablet yesterday so maybe its that but like, i cant think of a logical reason why that would go wrong so im left wondering why i feel so nervous, its really weird, very hard to relax like this	hit:2704_conv:5409_3_242
Well sometimes companies make mistakes. I doubt it's anything you did.	hit:2704_conv:5409_4_217
I've been recently thinking about the things we don't appreciate.	hit:2706_conv:5412_1_326
I think it's very common that we take things for granted. 	hit:2706_conv:5412_2_409
Is there anything that can change that?	hit:2706_conv:5412_3_326
I think you can really think about all that you have, and show your thanks that you have these things. 	hit:2706_conv:5412_4_409
Yah, was depressing.	hit:2708_conv:5417_1_406
What was depressing?	hit:2708_conv:5417_2_239
Well, just really did a lot of housework and felt we lost contact.	hit:2708_conv:5417_3_406
Oh, that sounds like a bummer. Do you think it will change?	hit:2708_conv:5417_4_239
Yes, it got so much better the next few days.	hit:2708_conv:5417_5_406
have you ever watched this show it was really quite good?	hit:2712_conv:5424_1_411
What is the name of the show?	hit:2712_conv:5424_2_7
It was called Hero's	hit:2712_conv:5424_3_411
No, I ever did.	hit:2712_conv:5424_4_7
it was actually quite good	hit:2712_conv:5424_5_411
I am currently waiting to receive my security deposit back from my old apartment.	hit:2714_conv:5428_1_221
why hasnt it already been returned?	hit:2714_conv:5428_2_242
They said it takes up to 30 days, and it's only been a few weeks.	hit:2714_conv:5428_3_221
if you live in america and they fail to return it in a timely manner, i hear you can go to small claims and get 3x the amount awarded to you 	hit:2714_conv:5428_4_242
Wow, that's good to know.	hit:2714_conv:5428_5_221
yeah r/legaladvice has a lot of posts like that so its something that stuck to me, Pretty neat to know that landlords cant just scam you	hit:2714_conv:5428_6_242
I ordered a surface pro yesterday! its gonna be so cool to play around with when it arrives	hit:2714_conv:5429_1_242
That's cool. I've always been a Mac kind of girl, but I would look into a Surface is I was in the market for a new computer.	hit:2714_conv:5429_2_221
i only ever wanted one cause they can do the same stuff a regular computer can but also touch screen so you can draw on it, i always got discouraged drawing on paper cause id waste so much of it, and then just stop	hit:2714_conv:5429_3_242
I get that. I got a bamboo tablet a few years ago, but I feel like working directly on the screen would be even better.	hit:2714_conv:5429_4_221
It was such a sweet moment.	hit:2715_conv:5430_1_406
what was ?	hit:2715_conv:5430_2_238
Spending time watching TV and sipping wine together.	hit:2715_conv:5430_3_406
oh that does sound nice	hit:2715_conv:5430_4_238
Do you like wine?	hit:2715_conv:5430_5_406
As the day was coming to an end, I was begging to believe that my solitude was perfect.  	hit:2717_conv:5434_1_326
Well in some ways solitude is nice.	hit:2717_conv:5434_2_217
Yes if you take it in portions. 	hit:2717_conv:5434_3_326
True everything is nice in bits. Too much of anything does get tiring.	hit:2717_conv:5434_4_217
But I needed to be responsible.	hit:2720_conv:5440_1_406
Be responsible about what?	hit:2720_conv:5440_2_221
Well, about getting daily chorses done--work first-- play later.	hit:2720_conv:5440_3_406
I understand. I have to get work around my house done today too, before I can go out.	hit:2720_conv:5440_4_221
Yes, it teaches us self-pride.	hit:2720_conv:5440_5_406
I got backed into last week by another car.	hit:2720_conv:5441_1_221
Oh no, sorry to hear, hope you are OK.	hit:2720_conv:5441_2_406
I'm fine, but they left a nasty dent in the front of my car. Now I have to get it fixed, which is a hassle.	hit:2720_conv:5441_3_221
I agree. Hope the car will look good again.	hit:2720_conv:5441_4_406
Meh i kinda feel bad, i wish i had family members to talk to	hit:2721_conv:5442_1_242
Sorry to hear that. Did you try to talk to a friend?	hit:2721_conv:5442_2_7
friends are cool but its not quite the same as a family member, a spouse would be but i dont have that either!	hit:2721_conv:5442_3_242
I understand	hit:2721_conv:5442_4_7
Yah, two colored socks is crazy.	hit:2723_conv:5447_1_406
I agree, where did you find them?	hit:2723_conv:5447_2_59
LOL, mixed up in my drawer.	hit:2723_conv:5447_3_406
Oh I see, Ha! I would have just worn them like that to be more fashionable!	hit:2723_conv:5447_4_59
Yes, funny.	hit:2723_conv:5447_5_406
when i was travelling alone in a car at night in ghat road suddenly some boulders fell on the road 	hit:2725_conv:5451_1_355
Was it an accident?	hit:2725_conv:5451_2_25
no the boulders fell 50 meters infront of me , luckily i was going slow and suddenly stopped	hit:2725_conv:5451_3_355
Oh ! Thank good ness! That was close	hit:2725_conv:5451_4_25
yes but i am so much worried for what happened that night	hit:2725_conv:5451_5_355
I ate so many macadamia nuts today, I don't know how to feel about it.	hit:2726_conv:5453_1_326
do you especially enjoy macadamia nuts or just eating?	hit:2726_conv:5453_2_405
It the only nut that I can eat, that's why I can't help overeating.	hit:2726_conv:5453_3_326
It must be difficult living with a nut allergy. Do you overeat on macadamia nuts regularly?	hit:2726_conv:5453_4_405
its sooooooo hot outside, 30c. its borderline impossible to deal with	hit:2727_conv:5454_1_242
It's awful out there. It's been in the 100's here in TX	hit:2727_conv:5454_2_221
oh no, texas is basically in a desert isnt it. for me on top of heat i also get some 3 wasps a day flying into my apartament and looking around, i just got one earlier and had to kill it to get rid of it. very annoying, apparently wasps love it though	hit:2727_conv:5454_3_242
That sucks! I hate wasps and most other bugs, so I feel your annoyance.	hit:2727_conv:5454_4_221
spiders are really the worst, thankfully it looks like the heat was useful for Something at least and killed them off	hit:2727_conv:5454_5_242
I start back at work in a couple of weeks.	hit:2727_conv:5455_1_221
what job did you apply to?	hit:2727_conv:5455_2_242
I'm a teacher, so I've been off this summer. I am looking forward to having 12th graders again this year.	hit:2727_conv:5455_3_221
Somehow i suspect that theyre not looking forward to having you though :P (no offence) i cant remember anyone that enjoyed high school lol. Its a good job though! literally backbone of society	hit:2727_conv:5455_4_242
Haha, true. I try to make it a little more enjoyable for them, but I've also been in their shoes.	hit:2727_conv:5455_5_221
I always trust my family like my mom to give me good advice.	hit:2728_conv:5457_1_406
Yeah that's always comforting.  Mom's are awesome	hit:2728_conv:5457_2_389
Do you ever disagree with your Mom?	hit:2728_conv:5457_3_406
Not really.  We usually tend to think alike.  Why do you ask?  	hit:2728_conv:5457_4_389
Aww, I didn't really relate until I had children of my own	hit:2728_conv:5457_5_406
Cool.  So you're the awesome mother here?	hit:2728_conv:5457_6_389
We both are.	hit:2728_conv:5457_7_406
i was really pissed off when i found out my best friend slept with my girlfriend. i was shaking all over!	hit:2730_conv:5460_1_391
I'm sorry to hear that	hit:2730_conv:5460_2_413
yeah well. what you gonna do.. thats life..	hit:2730_conv:5460_3_391
:( did you stay friends with him?	hit:2730_conv:5460_4_413
hell no.. i could never look at him again	hit:2730_conv:5460_5_391
i had recently applied for graduate masters in very prestigious universities but initially i was worried whether i get admission or not	hit:2732_conv:5464_1_355
did you get admission? 	hit:2732_conv:5464_2_413
yeah i thought the competition was tough and i may not get admitted, but luckily i was admitted	hit:2732_conv:5464_3_355
That's great news, well done. 	hit:2732_conv:5464_4_413
yes i am totally relived of that stress now	hit:2732_conv:5464_5_355
:) 	hit:2732_conv:5464_6_413
I hate when I am tired.	hit:2734_conv:5469_1_406
Me too, especially when it's still the middle of the day.	hit:2734_conv:5469_2_414
or in the case here, morning	hit:2734_conv:5469_3_406
Oh yes, you're right. I'm in the same boat right now!	hit:2734_conv:5469_4_414
I just need six good hours of sleep	hit:2734_conv:5469_5_406
i ate 3 pizzas just earlier and i feel so good and relaxed now, almost tranquility	hit:2736_conv:5472_1_242
I think I am missing something, you said you feel more that ok after 3 pizzas???	hit:2736_conv:5472_2_326
yeah i know right, a lot, and i am pretty thin so i shouldnt feel ok, But i totally do feel great .	hit:2736_conv:5472_3_242
It's definitely some kind of anomaly. 	hit:2736_conv:5472_4_326
i think you just dont appreciate how good pizza is	hit:2736_conv:5472_5_242
Sometime ago I was really hungry and decided to treat myself to some well reviewed restaurant, well it was all I hoped for.	hit:2736_conv:5473_1_326
What did you eat there? 	hit:2736_conv:5473_2_242
Onion soup with croutons.	hit:2736_conv:5473_3_326
ooooh onion soup sounds really good, onions do taste incredibly well if cooked well with the correct dish	hit:2736_conv:5473_4_242
i was extremely disgusted when a close friend of mine threw up on my baby. he was really drunk at a party we were at	hit:2738_conv:5477_1_391
I would have flipped and never talked to him again. I am so sorry my god what did you do? 	hit:2738_conv:5477_2_11
what else can i do? i washed my kid clean and got the hell out of there	hit:2738_conv:5477_3_391
Idk beat him up, lol. throw a drink at him, the sky is the limit! 	hit:2738_conv:5477_4_11
I just finished making my bulletin board at work.	hit:2740_conv:5480_1_221
cool, how did it come by?	hit:2740_conv:5480_2_391
I'm happy with it. Hopefully my students like it too.	hit:2740_conv:5480_3_221
if you put so much work into it, im sure they will	hit:2740_conv:5480_4_391
i was so angry when i found out that my girlfriend cheated on me.. dont know how i can forgive her	hit:2740_conv:5481_1_391
I am so sorry! I would have a hard time forgiving that betrayal of trust. How long have you been together?	hit:2740_conv:5481_2_221
3 years	hit:2740_conv:5481_3_391
Wow. I hope that you can work it out, but I would understand why you wouldn't want to.	hit:2740_conv:5481_4_221
I really feel nostalgic around christmas	hit:2744_conv:5488_1_391
really? well, who doesnt!	hit:2744_conv:5488_2_416
true.. there is something about that holiday that makes us wanna be kids again	hit:2744_conv:5488_3_391
i actually feel like a kid even now during christmas	hit:2744_conv:5488_4_416
my dad gave me the greatest gift ever on my graduation	hit:2745_conv:5491_1_391
wow, what was it?	hit:2745_conv:5491_2_416

thank you so much.. i moved from Idaho.. so this is very new to me, all this	hit:2746_conv:5493_3_391
Oh yeah sounds like its super new to you especially if you are in the city. I was in the middle of no where so pretty much felt like Idaho where I lived in NY. :p 	hit:2746_conv:5493_4_11
i felt heartbroken when my girlfriend moved away without telling me first	hit:2747_conv:5495_1_391
I would too why would she not tell you!? Did yall break up? 	hit:2747_conv:5495_2_11
we had a fight, i never knew we were broken up though	hit:2747_conv:5495_3_391
That sounds like poor communication on her part maybe its better for you she moved. :/ 	hit:2747_conv:5495_4_11
hi there it was a hard day when this incident occured.	hit:2749_conv:5498_1_417
What incident was that ?	hit:2749_conv:5498_2_225
i was driving home and it started to rain	hit:2749_conv:5498_3_417
what happened then ?	hit:2749_conv:5498_4_225
my tire went out and was going to call fro help. I didn't get a chance to call.	hit:2749_conv:5498_5_417
my dad passed away around the time of christmas.. it always casts a shadow over my holidays	hit:2751_conv:5503_1_391
"I know what you mean, it sucks when those ""dates"" linger over us even if we try not to think about them. Im so sorry to hear that! "	hit:2751_conv:5503_2_11
yeah.. i know it is time to get over it. but certain memories are so haunting	hit:2751_conv:5503_3_391
"Its not time to get over it, you arent doing any wrong its okay to ""feel"" things. I hope people around you give you a lot of love! "	hit:2751_conv:5503_4_11
i feel like my dog is my child time after another.. love him so much	hit:2753_conv:5506_1_391
i understand what you are saying, pets are always close to our hearts	hit:2753_conv:5506_2_416
very true, do you have any pets?	hit:2753_conv:5506_3_391
yeah, i have 2 german shepards	hit:2753_conv:5506_4_416
i was shaking when i was watching conjuring in the movies	hit:2754_conv:5509_1_391
is it a scary movie?	hit:2754_conv:5509_2_238
it is a terrifying movie. havent you seen it yet?	hit:2754_conv:5509_3_391
no i never heard of it	hit:2754_conv:5509_4_238
yesterday i was so angry at my parents.. but i kept my mouth shut and came away. i cant hurt them, i feel so faithful	hit:2756_conv:5513_1_391
yea thats probably the best choice to make	hit:2756_conv:5513_2_238
i always think all those hard times they had bringing me up	hit:2756_conv:5513_3_391
i can understand that	hit:2756_conv:5513_4_238
some guy threw up on the street last night right before me.. i was grossed out	hit:2761_conv:5522_1_391
Yuck, that is terrible. I would be grossed out too. What did you do?	hit:2761_conv:5522_2_13
i got the hell out of there right away!	hit:2761_conv:5522_3_391
I'm sure you did. Guess he couldn't make it to the trash can.	hit:2761_conv:5522_4_13
I saw some pictures recently of when my family and I went on vacation when I was little.	hit:2761_conv:5523_1_13

Those are great aren'	hit:2777_conv:5555_2_296
do you have a large family?	hit:2777_conv:5555_3_44
Sorry(Those are great aren't they?) I do not but we always had sunday breakfast for many years. Those memories are to be cherished and repeated :)	hit:2777_conv:5555_4_296
My roommate recently moved out of my house so now it is just me and my dog.  My dog is really nice and doesn't really bark unless he sees a stranger coming up to the house.  Lately he has been sitting at the top of the steps to the basement and growls/barks.  However, there are no windows to the basement and he wouldnt be able to see into the basement.  I have no idea why he has been barking at that door lately.	hit:2778_conv:5556_1_318
wow that is a lot to take in.  get a muzzle	hit:2778_conv:5556_2_238
I'm not bothered by him barking.  As someone who watches a lot of scary movies it is more of a worry factor that someone is down there than anything.	hit:2778_conv:5556_3_318
i can understand that	hit:2778_conv:5556_4_238
I got a job offer at another company that pays more, but I turned them down because I've been with my current company for ten years.	hit:2779_conv:5559_1_250
Do you think it was the right decision?	hit:2779_conv:5559_2_262
Definitely, my company always treat's me right. They haven't gave me a reason to want to leave. 	hit:2779_conv:5559_3_250
That's great. Maybe you will get a raise too	hit:2779_conv:5559_4_262
i felt shy when i dropped my groceries in the parking lot	hit:2782_conv:5565_1_44
why is that	hit:2782_conv:5565_2_238
because there were soda cans rolling all around the parking lot and i was scrambling to pick them all up	hit:2782_conv:5565_3_44
oh i can understand that	hit:2782_conv:5565_4_238
The other day an intruder broke into my home. I had to hide in the closet while I called the cops.	hit:2784_conv:5569_1_250
That must have been terrifying	hit:2784_conv:5569_2_262
It was, the whole time I was shaking and breathing heavily.	hit:2784_conv:5569_3_250
I don't know what I would have done	hit:2784_conv:5569_4_262
My dog Lola won first place in the dog show. That's my girl!	hit:2801_conv:5603_1_250
Awesome! What kind of dog is Lola?	hit:2801_conv:5603_2_123
She's a Pekingese. When they handed me the trophy I just couldn't stop smiling. She's the best dog I could ask for.	hit:2801_conv:5603_3_250
I don't think I would have been able to stop smiling either! That is so awesome!	hit:2801_conv:5603_4_123
i was happy this morning when i received an email from my grandma	hit:2805_conv:5611_1_44
That's nice, is she technologically savvy?	hit:2805_conv:5611_2_100
not really but she tries haha	hit:2805_conv:5611_3_44
Well it's nice she's making the effort!	hit:2805_conv:5611_4_100
i love reading old letters from family members	hit:2808_conv:5617_1_44
I do too. I have a box filled with them. How old is your oldest?	hit:2808_conv:5617_2_22
i have some old ones from the korean war	hit:2808_conv:5617_3_44
wow!	hit:2808_conv:5617_4_22
I have everything ready for back to school supplies for my son to start school.	hit:2809_conv:5618_1_26
That's good. Now you don't have to worry about it.	hit:2809_conv:5618_2_250
That is true! I also have his outfit picked out for the first day of school.	hit:2809_conv:5618_3_26
Wow, your son is lucky to have a parent who is on top of things!	hit:2809_conv:5618_4_250
I bet my cousin that I could beat him at a game of basketball. He's horrible at playing so I knew I could beat him.	hit:2809_conv:5619_1_250
What did you bet?	hit:2809_conv:5619_2_26
I bet him $1000 because that's how good I am. I had no doubt in my mind I could win. I ended up obliterating him and taking his shoes too.	hit:2809_conv:5619_3_250
That would be awesome! Did your cousin pay you?	hit:2809_conv:5619_4_26
i was sad to hear my mom is in the ER again	hit:2811_conv:5623_1_44
Oh no, I am sorry to hear that. I hope she is okay.	hit:2811_conv:5623_2_123
me too, she has heart problems unfortunately	hit:2811_conv:5623_3_44
I am so sorry. I hope she is able to get some relief and rest.	hit:2811_conv:5623_4_123
thank you i appreciate the kind words	hit:2811_conv:5623_5_44
My son said his first word the other day. My little man is going to be smart just like his pop's.	hit:2813_conv:5626_1_250
Oh man! That must have been great to hear! What did he say?	hit:2813_conv:5626_2_313
He said poop. When I heard It I jumped up with joy. That's my boy!	hit:2813_conv:5626_3_250
That's so funny! That's one of those things you will definitely remember forever!	hit:2813_conv:5626_4_313
im envious of my friends who are at the park right now while im stuck inside	hit:2815_conv:5630_1_44
Oh I can understand that! I would also like to be outside; it looks like such a beautiful day! At least it is almost the weekend!	hit:2815_conv:5630_2_320

That's great! Are you going to join your friends at the park?	hit:2815_conv:5630_4_320
I was walking through a trail to get to my house last night and it was pitch black. I was afraid a bear or something might get me lol	hit:2822_conv:5644_1_260
You should have taken a flashlight just in case. 	hit:2822_conv:5644_2_423
I was gonna use my phone but it died, so I just sprinted for like half an hour.	hit:2822_conv:5644_3_260
hey at least you got a nice workout in!	hit:2822_conv:5644_4_423
Yeah way to look at it positive lol. There was a river nearby so at least it sounded kind of relaxing.	hit:2822_conv:5644_5_260
That is true. Well I'm glad you made it home safely. Maybe next time maybe go a little earlier before it gets so dark out.	hit:2822_conv:5644_6_423
For sure, or at least charge my phone haha. Thx I'm glad I didnt get mauled by a bear too	hit:2822_conv:5644_7_260
 i felt sick after eating too much ice cream last night	hit:2824_conv:5649_1_44
I had ice cream too! Sorry you got sick	hit:2824_conv:5649_2_126
its my own fault i went past my limit lol	hit:2824_conv:5649_3_44
Ha, at least it was good	hit:2824_conv:5649_4_126
I took my pup to the park last weekend and he had fun meeting other dogs and their owners!	hit:2825_conv:5650_1_260
Thats always fun! Does your pup do well with other dogs?	hit:2825_conv:5650_2_423
Yeah he is a golden so he is happy no matter what lol. He will go up to people and not leave until they pet him.	hit:2825_conv:5650_3_260
Mine does the same thing. Goldens are so adorable.	hit:2825_conv:5650_4_423
Absolutely! What kind of dog do you have?	hit:2825_conv:5650_5_260
He is just a mix breed. We really don't even know.	hit:2825_conv:5650_6_423
Mixed breeds usually look really cool.	hit:2825_conv:5650_7_260
So I was drunk coming back from a party and woke up to find I peed the bed lol. First time in like 24 years.	hit:2827_conv:5654_1_260
lol, it happens to us all	hit:2827_conv:5654_2_44
Yea you cant help but feel like a stupid little kid or something, at least I did lol.	hit:2827_conv:5654_3_260
haha true	hit:2827_conv:5654_4_44
Got any crazy drinking stories?	hit:2827_conv:5654_5_260
i felt dumb when I lost my receipt	hit:2827_conv:5655_1_44
That sucks did you need to return something?	hit:2827_conv:5655_2_260
yes some printer ink	hit:2827_conv:5655_3_44
That stuff is pretty expensive. Maybe you can sell it on eBay or something.	hit:2827_conv:5655_4_260
So I was on the bus back from a party and a drunk guy barfed on me at a stop lol. Most of it got on my jacket and he didnt even apologize.	hit:2829_conv:5658_1_260
Oh wow! I would have been so disgusted and outraged! What did you do?	hit:2829_conv:5658_2_320
Well I didn't want to start a fight or anything, so I just took it off and held my nose the rest of the ride. Then I washed it like 6 times lol	hit:2829_conv:5658_3_260
That must have been a terrible experience. I'm not sure that I would be able to wear that jacket again.	hit:2829_conv:5658_4_320
I wouldnt have but it was a pretty expensive northface I had for many years.	hit:2829_conv:5658_5_260
I can't wait for college in the fall! I left 2 years ago and am back feeling more confident in my studying abilities.	hit:2832_conv:5664_1_260

Thanks anything youre looking forward to?	hit:2832_conv:5664_3_260

Cool when was the last time you saw them?	hit:2832_conv:5664_5_260
i was happy with myself for working hard this week	hit:2832_conv:5665_1_44
Good job what did you work hard on?	hit:2832_conv:5665_2_260
my job and at the gym	hit:2832_conv:5665_3_44
Nice keep it up!	hit:2832_conv:5665_4_260

That is awesome!  What are you studying	hit:2833_conv:5667_2_103
Ya thanks it's mechanical engineering I have 2 years left.	hit:2833_conv:5667_3_260
was it hard to go back or are you enjoying it?	hit:2833_conv:5667_4_103
Oh I am going back in a few weeks. It will probably be hard but I will enjoy it for sure.	hit:2833_conv:5667_5_260
Well good luck!  I am sure you will do great!	hit:2833_conv:5667_6_103
Thank you! I sure hope so.	hit:2833_conv:5667_7_260
So last weekend it poured rain all day and I chilled at my house by myself. Pretty boring.	hit:2836_conv:5672_1_260
I do like the rain though	hit:2836_conv:5672_2_126
It is relaxing, the only thing is that you can't do anything outside really. Had some plans but they got canceled.	hit:2836_conv:5672_3_260
I am sure you will have plans again	hit:2836_conv:5672_4_126
That's true, it's good to look forward to the future.	hit:2836_conv:5672_5_260
Yeah, I am sure it will be fine	hit:2836_conv:5672_6_126
Yeah did you do anything exciting last weeked?	hit:2836_conv:5672_7_260
I saw a dude driving a Porsche down the street of my city. Was definitely jealous lol	hit:2840_conv:5680_1_260
I would have been to. I always wonder how people make the money necessary to buy vehicles like that.	hit:2840_conv:5680_2_320
Yeah I am thinking this guy must be a CEO or something. If I had the money I would buy one for sure.	hit:2840_conv:5680_3_260
Same here. I saw a Ferrari at the supermarket the other day. I was jealous, and I also thought about how I would be worried something would happen to it (if it were mine).	hit:2840_conv:5680_4_320
Yeah I guess if something happened you are probably rich enough to just buy another lol.	hit:2840_conv:5680_5_260
Yesterday, I ate a whole pizza by myself!	hit:2846_conv:5693_1_250
I take you don't have issued with you weight.	hit:2846_conv:5693_2_75
No, I just did it because nobody thought I could.	hit:2846_conv:5693_3_250
Ok, then.If it was a 1 thing only, no problem.	hit:2846_conv:5693_4_75
This guy at school keeps following me around. He followed me all day yesterday. I think he want's to be my friend.	hit:2854_conv:5709_1_250
Is he acting creepy at all? 	hit:2854_conv:5709_2_423
It's getting to that point. I wish he would just stop. I have enough friends already.	hit:2854_conv:5709_3_250
Have you tried to talk to him at all and see what his deal is?	hit:2854_conv:5709_4_423
Im proud of my dogs behaing around new visitors	hit:2856_conv:5712_1_255
That's good you have well-behaved dogs, did you train them?	hit:2856_conv:5712_2_100
Not on purpose, but they have learned from right and wrong from me	hit:2856_conv:5712_3_255
Well it's good you're doing something right.	hit:2856_conv:5712_4_100
Do you have pets	hit:2856_conv:5712_5_255
The other day I went on a airplane and had a panic attack the whole time. I'm not good with heights.	hit:2861_conv:5722_1_250
Oh no! What did you do to bring yourself down? (from the panic attack)	hit:2861_conv:5722_2_423
I had to cover my head with a blanket, and picture myself somewhere else. That's how bad it was.	hit:2861_conv:5722_3_250
I'm sorry. That sounds bad. Flying always makes me nervous but I usually make it ok.	hit:2861_conv:5722_4_423
I don't have a lot of friends.	hit:2863_conv:5726_1_26
Well we are friends aren't we? I do appreciate you as one.	hit:2863_conv:5726_2_68
Thanks. In my mom's group, I feel like a lot of the moms are friends but I'm not friends with any of them.	hit:2863_conv:5726_3_26
You wanna maybe go to the bar with my other friends this weekend? They will probably like you. Tim likes some things you do.	hit:2863_conv:5726_4_68
That sounds nice, I just need to connect with someone.	hit:2863_conv:5726_5_26
I was in a small fender bender earlier this week. Now I am scared that I will be in an even worse wreck.	hit:2864_conv:5729_1_26
Oh i hate it when i get those kind of thoughts but eventually you recover and don't think about it.	hit:2864_conv:5729_2_68
I hope so. I am driving and I just get so scared. 	hit:2864_conv:5729_3_26
Just relax more you got this and it was just a fender bender.	hit:2864_conv:5729_4_68
I took my son out and did a bunch of nice stuff for him.  He was great until we got to naptime.	hit:2867_conv:5734_1_26
Naptime is a good thing though isnt it	hit:2867_conv:5734_2_126
It is but he threw a huge temper tantrum at naptime. 	hit:2867_conv:5734_3_26
Well that is never good	hit:2867_conv:5734_4_126
For mother's day, my son had to fill out a paper in school that asked a bunch of questions. 	hit:2869_conv:5739_1_26
That doesnt sound too fun	hit:2869_conv:5739_2_126
I read it when he got home and alot of his responses involved mommy said a bad word!	hit:2869_conv:5739_3_26
Oh wow, the kid is a snitch	hit:2869_conv:5739_4_126
i was upset i woke up so late today	hit:2871_conv:5743_1_44
It happens, everyone does it	hit:2871_conv:5743_2_126
yeah thats true, not the end of the world;	hit:2871_conv:5743_3_44
I am sure you will fix it	hit:2871_conv:5743_4_126
i am annoyed at my neighbor's loud lawnmower	hit:2877_conv:5754_1_44
Have you spoken to him about it?	hit:2877_conv:5754_2_111
nope its happening right now	hit:2877_conv:5754_3_44
Are you going to do anything about it in the future?	hit:2877_conv:5754_4_111
I was able to find a new job after being fired	hit:2877_conv:5755_1_111
congratulations im glad, hopefully you will like it more than your last job	hit:2877_conv:5755_2_44
It turned out to be better than my last one for the most part	hit:2877_conv:5755_3_111
im glad to hear that	hit:2877_conv:5755_4_44
I went to a restaurant and ordered some pizza	hit:2878_conv:5756_1_111
what kind of pizza?	hit:2878_conv:5756_2_44
Bacon and sausage pizza.  Unfortunately, it also had a cockroach crawling across it when I picked it up	hit:2878_conv:5756_3_111
what!! i hope u got your money back	hit:2878_conv:5756_4_44
i was nervous about my car overheating	hit:2878_conv:5757_1_44
Why's that?	hit:2878_conv:5757_2_111
it was over 100 degrees outside and i was low on antifreeze	hit:2878_conv:5757_3_44
Did your car end up overheating?	hit:2878_conv:5757_4_111
A supervisor I didn't like got fired	hit:2879_conv:5758_1_111
Thats great! But what did they do that you didn't like?	hit:2879_conv:5758_2_328
He and I never got along, seemed like he tried to sabotage me	hit:2879_conv:5758_3_111
Well looks like that didn't work out for him in the end. What finally got him axed?	hit:2879_conv:5758_4_328
i felt upset about losing my friend's blu ray i borrowed	hit:2882_conv:5764_1_44
Did you replace it?	hit:2882_conv:5764_2_111
not yet im still looking for it	hit:2882_conv:5764_3_44
Do you think he'll get angry?	hit:2882_conv:5764_4_111
I was walking down the sidewalk at night and thought I saw someone following me	hit:2882_conv:5765_1_111
did you start walking faster?	hit:2882_conv:5765_2_44
Yeah, tried to get out of there	hit:2882_conv:5765_3_111
hopefully you made it out safely	hit:2882_conv:5765_4_44
My neighbors really look out for each other	hit:2884_conv:5768_1_255
That is good to hear. What happened that made you think so?	hit:2884_conv:5768_2_139
They always holding hands and smiling	hit:2884_conv:5768_3_255
Oh ok. That sounds like they really get along well. It is nice to have good neighbors.	hit:2884_conv:5768_4_139
Yes it is , so far	hit:2884_conv:5768_5_255
i was worried when I heard my friend was in the hospital	hit:2886_conv:5772_1_44
Oh no!  Was he OK?  I hope it was nothing serious!	hit:2886_conv:5772_2_277
no he has already been released thankfully	hit:2886_conv:5772_3_44
That's good to know!  You all have a lot to be thankful for!	hit:2886_conv:5772_4_277
I loaned my neighbor some money. Hopefully he pays it back today	hit:2888_conv:5777_1_255
I would hope so too or else the relationship would be awkward.	hit:2888_conv:5777_2_100
Yes thats true, to say the least	hit:2888_conv:5777_3_255
I hope it wasn't too much money just in case.	hit:2888_conv:5777_4_100
Around 30, but ive know him a while	hit:2888_conv:5777_5_255

What you you have planned?	hit:2890_conv:5780_2_75
nothing! thats why im excited lol	hit:2890_conv:5780_3_44
Really?? It sounds like there was something going on.	hit:2890_conv:5780_4_75
I cleaned the refridgerator out the other day and I found something that had gone very very bad.	hit:2891_conv:5782_1_61
Oh that's never a good situation. It happens to the best of us though. I need to clean my fridge	hit:2891_conv:5782_2_135
I put it off too long this time. It was pretty stinky, my dogs thought I was nuts for throwing food away. 	hit:2891_conv:5782_3_61
I'm sure they were thinking waste not, want not. haha	hit:2891_conv:5782_4_135
I was reading through some old school papers	hit:2900_conv:5801_1_111
Oh yeah? Find anything interesting?	hit:2900_conv:5801_2_209
It made me think about how far I've come since.  I also felt like I was in a different time and place reading them	hit:2900_conv:5801_3_111
Ah, nothing quite like that feeling. I remember when I was on the school newspaper. Good times.	hit:2900_conv:5801_4_209
My friends went out to a party	hit:2901_conv:5803_1_111
Are you going, too?	hit:2901_conv:5803_2_1
They didn't invite me for some reason	hit:2901_conv:5803_3_111
Oh no, that sucks. Would you have wanted to go though?	hit:2901_conv:5803_4_1
My roommate left a bunch of dishes in the kitchen	hit:2902_conv:5804_1_111
Well, that's not cool.	hit:2902_conv:5804_2_1
I wish he'd pick up after himself	hit:2902_conv:5804_3_111
Does he do that stuff often?	hit:2902_conv:5804_4_1
I was busy with a work related project	hit:2904_conv:5808_1_111
Oh? What kind of project?	hit:2904_conv:5808_2_234
Presentation, a co-worker came in and helped me out	hit:2904_conv:5808_3_111
Oh that's nice of them! 	hit:2904_conv:5808_4_234
I put in extra hours at work	hit:2905_conv:5811_1_111
That's good, do you get paid over time?	hit:2905_conv:5811_2_100
Yeah, I would like for my boss to notice and promote me at some point	hit:2905_conv:5811_3_111
I think if you keep it up you'll get the recognition you want soon.	hit:2905_conv:5811_4_100
I was taking a stroll at night and saw a group of guys up ahead	hit:2908_conv:5817_1_111
Was everything okay? What were they doing?	hit:2908_conv:5817_2_220
I ended up turning around, who knows what they were up to	hit:2908_conv:5817_3_111
True, you never know these days.	hit:2908_conv:5817_4_220
I accidentally dropped my phone in the toilet	hit:2909_conv:5818_1_111
Is your phone waterproof?	hit:2909_conv:5818_2_269
My case was, as the phone still worked	hit:2909_conv:5818_3_111
You are so lucky! My phone would have been done...	hit:2909_conv:5818_4_269
I've been consistently working out the past few weeks	hit:2911_conv:5822_1_111
That's great! Are you seeing results?	hit:2911_conv:5822_2_27
Absolutely, I feel so much better too	hit:2911_conv:5822_3_111
I bought a spin bike but I haven't used it yet	hit:2911_conv:5822_4_27
I took some cookies my roommate left out in the open	hit:2914_conv:5828_1_111
Maybe they were left for you.	hit:2914_conv:5828_2_27
I think he meant to save them	hit:2914_conv:5828_3_111
He can't save them out in the open. What kind were they?	hit:2914_conv:5828_4_27
A friend forgot his phone at the library	hit:2916_conv:5832_1_111
Did he get it back? I hate it when that happens...	hit:2916_conv:5832_2_269
I went back and grabbed it for him	hit:2916_conv:5832_3_111
You are a true friend indeed. I bet he is very appreciative!	hit:2916_conv:5832_4_269
A friend of mine was having a hard time finding a job	hit:2920_conv:5841_1_111
Did he eventually find one?	hit:2920_conv:5841_2_4
After months of work, he at least got an interview	hit:2920_conv:5841_3_111
That is making progress.	hit:2920_conv:5841_4_4
I recently graduated college, I'm so glad I finally got it done!	hit:2960_conv:5921_1_430
Congratulations!  What do you plan on doing?	hit:2960_conv:5921_2_322

That is a great goal to set for yourself.	hit:2960_conv:5921_4_322
Thank you. I'm really excited!	hit:2960_conv:5921_5_430
I recently spent a couple of restless days awaiting the results of a skin biopsy.  I had a weird mole come up out of nowhere.	hit:2981_conv:5962_1_339
I am sorry to hear that. I hope the results will be good.	hit:2981_conv:5962_2_7
I got them back yesterday, and it was good news.  No cancer!	hit:2981_conv:5962_3_339

Yes, it was really good news.  I have a profound sense of relief.	hit:2981_conv:5962_5_339
Awhile back, our whole household was awoken by someone kicking hard at our front door.	hit:2983_conv:5967_1_339
Was it an intruder?	hit:2983_conv:5967_2_269
No, it was my drunk cousin, lol.  She had tried knocking and we didn't hear her.	hit:2983_conv:5967_3_339
What a surprise haha	hit:2983_conv:5967_4_269
Yes, it was a bit scary at first, but then funny.	hit:2983_conv:5967_5_339
i was upset i woke up so late today	hit:2995_conv:5991_1_44
I did too. Did you go out last night?	hit:2995_conv:5991_2_262

Oh my god! That's something to be proud of, congrats!	hit:3013_conv:6027_4_296
Yesterday was my day off and I spent the whole day in bed looking at the ceiling. My friends and family didn't even call or check up on me.	hit:3015_conv:6031_1_250
I am sorry you are feeling like this.  Maybe you should reach out to someone	hit:3015_conv:6031_2_267
It's like they only call me when they need something. The only friend I have is myself.	hit:3015_conv:6031_3_250
I am sorry that you are going through this	hit:3015_conv:6031_4_267
The other day I got on a roller coaster for the first time, and I almost pooped my pants because we were so high up.	hit:3022_conv:6045_1_250
Oh wow, now that's funny! I've only been on one roller coaster and it was rather small, but I loved it!	hit:3022_conv:6045_2_286
This roller coaster was one of the biggest in the world and i'm not good with heights.	hit:3022_conv:6045_3_250
Oh wow! I'd love to go on a much larger coaster than the one I road. But it might be scarier than I imagine.	hit:3022_conv:6045_4_286
i couldnt believe how good my nephew is at little league	hit:3026_conv:6053_1_44
How old is he?	hit:3026_conv:6053_2_7

They are still cute at this age and they make a lot of progress.	hit:3026_conv:6053_4_7
The other day I was on a date with a beautiful women and I accidentally spilled wine on her dress.	hit:3027_conv:6054_1_250

She hasn't returned any of my calls. I feel horrible.	hit:3027_conv:6054_3_250
Oh no! Well, honestly if she can't deal with one mistake, then it's no good anyhow. But maybe it was something else. Sometimes people just don't click.	hit:3027_conv:6054_4_296
Yesterday was my first time at a karaoke bar. I started to get all tense when my friends kept telling my I should go on stage to perform.	hit:3035_conv:6070_1_250
I feel you! I don't like to perform in front of people either. Did you decline?	hit:3035_conv:6070_2_296
No, I ended up going through with it. I was worried that they would boo me at first because my singing is horrible, but I guess everyone was too drunk to care.	hit:3035_conv:6070_3_250
Oh you can be as bad as you want there, it just matters if you're having fun :)	hit:3035_conv:6070_4_296
I finally purchased the house of my dreams. We barley finished moving in yesterday.	hit:3048_conv:6096_1_250

im envious that my friends are off work all weekend	hit:3056_conv:6112_1_44
I understand how lonely it can be when your schedule doesn't fit with your old friends.	hit:3056_conv:6112_2_436
yeah true but i cant blame them	hit:3056_conv:6112_3_44
You can make new friends. Its just part of the human experience. Everything is temporary	hit:3056_conv:6112_4_436

I'm sorry to hear that. Where did they go?	hit:3065_conv:6131_2_1
Mexico. I had to work.	hit:3065_conv:6131_3_259
Oh man, Sometimes it's hard to strike that work life balance.	hit:3065_conv:6131_4_1
im nervous about an interview next week	hit:3068_conv:6137_1_44
Who is the interview with?	hit:3068_conv:6137_2_4
a possible employer	hit:3068_conv:6137_3_44
Are you going to wear a suit?	hit:3068_conv:6137_4_4
im scared that we will go to war soon	hit:3071_conv:6143_1_44
War would be terrifying. What makes you think we will?	hit:3071_conv:6143_2_1
just general unrest and instability globally	hit:3071_conv:6143_3_44
Yea. Seems to be more of that lately.	hit:3071_conv:6143_4_1
im frustrated by all the other drivers on the road lately	hit:3075_conv:6150_1_44
What have they been doing?	hit:3075_conv:6150_2_4
just generally driving poorly and not using signals	hit:3075_conv:6150_3_44
Do you honk at them?	hit:3075_conv:6150_4_4
i saw a guy lift a car, he was so strong	hit:3078_conv:6157_1_327

it was a strong man contest.  he wasn't that big either, just really strong.	hit:3078_conv:6157_3_327
Oh I've heard of those contests. Must be exciting to see.	hit:3078_conv:6157_4_1
yes it was.  i was just so impressed because he was the smallest guy there but no one else could lift it.	hit:3078_conv:6157_5_327
i was shocked by how many people showed up to protest	hit:3080_conv:6161_1_44
What is the protest for?	hit:3080_conv:6161_2_1
free speech	hit:3080_conv:6161_3_44

i was fired from my job.	hit:3088_conv:6177_1_327
I'm so sorry to hear that!	hit:3088_conv:6177_2_1
i was crushed, didn't even see it coming.	hit:3088_conv:6177_3_327
Did they say why?	hit:3088_conv:6177_4_1
yes they said they didn't have any work for me.	hit:3088_conv:6177_5_327

Yes!! Try to walk through walmart, people are so rude! 	hit:3092_conv:6184_3_327
Here I was hoping a Walmart would open in my area. Guess it's a good thing there isn't one.	hit:3092_conv:6184_4_1

i called the police and my insurance company.  people just have no respect.	hit:3095_conv:6190_3_327
Yeah, It bothers me when people don't take responsibility for their actions.	hit:3095_conv:6190_4_277
they were probably on heroine or something	hit:3095_conv:6190_5_327
Went on a first date last night. I had chocolate from the appetizer in my beard the entire time. 	hit:3118_conv:6237_1_60
Lol. Why didn't she tell you?	hit:3118_conv:6237_2_27
I don't know. She was strange. I did not notice until I went to the restroom right before I left. 	hit:3118_conv:6237_3_60
So you're not gonna see her again?	hit:3118_conv:6237_4_27
She text me today but I'm not interested. She was beautiful but not very smart at all.	hit:3118_conv:6237_5_60
Gotta have brains	hit:3118_conv:6237_6_27

To show my self I had self control. I was drinking like 5 cups a day.	hit:3121_conv:6242_3_60

Today as soon as my lips touched the cup. I felt my soul smile.	hit:3121_conv:6242_5_60
I bet. I get that feeling every morning with a Dr Pepper	hit:3121_conv:6242_6_27
So I have a private office at work. Someone broke in the morning and stole $20 off my desk. 	hit:3123_conv:6246_1_60
Why would you have twenty dollars on the desk	hit:3123_conv:6246_2_27
For the vending machine at lunch. I lock my wallet up took 20 out put on my desk. Had to run to the bathroom. Came back and it was gone. I share my office with no one.	hit:3123_conv:6246_3_60
OH. Thats terrible.	hit:3123_conv:6246_4_27
Got a fresh cut today. My hair is on Fleak. Tots I'm beautiful.	hit:3125_conv:6251_1_60

where is that	hit:3209_conv:6418_2_238
I've been there sometime age, it's in Ukraine, Kiev.	hit:3209_conv:6418_3_326
oh id love to visit there one day when its a more stable area	hit:3209_conv:6418_4_238
I never thought I could love someone as much as my little baby girl.	hit:3271_conv:6543_1_147
I know! It's almost an unexplainable feeling isn't it?	hit:3271_conv:6543_2_243
Yes, It is so hard to describe honestly!	hit:3271_conv:6543_3_147
But it is also the best feeling ever! Enjoy every moment!	hit:3271_conv:6543_4_243
Thank you! It is hard at times tho when getting little sleep.	hit:3271_conv:6543_5_147
Best advice I ever got was that housework can wait and take naps whenever you cam when the baby sleeps!	hit:3271_conv:6543_6_243
Man I can't believe I almost bought that thing!	hit:3368_conv:6737_1_132
What did you almost buy?	hit:3368_conv:6737_2_234
I saw this great used car in a print ad, and went to the dealership, but when I got there, it was all ratty and crappy looking!	hit:3368_conv:6737_3_132
Ah, yea, I've had the once or twice. When you buy used you have to go in with the mindset of haggle down, find a decent one, or leave	hit:3368_conv:6737_4_234
The guy used an old picture of the car to fool me!  What a jerk!	hit:3368_conv:6737_5_132
For some reason heavy rain at night brings up some good memories for me.	hit:3371_conv:6742_1_326
I love heavy rain, it just really soothes me.	hit:3371_conv:6742_2_55
Yes, the sound that it makes when the windows are open...	hit:3371_conv:6742_3_326
I know! Also the thunder is so cool to listen to.	hit:3371_conv:6742_4_55
I wasn't feeling right a few days ago, but I guess I'm alright now.	hit:3374_conv:6748_1_326
I did a research on a cancer vaccine  	hit:3374_conv:6748_2_329
Well I meant my mood, not my health in general.	hit:3374_conv:6748_3_326
Oh sorry for the mix up	hit:3374_conv:6748_4_329
As I was people watching today I suddenly felt very happy.	hit:3376_conv:6752_1_326
What happened to you?	hit:3376_conv:6752_2_329
That's a thing, nothing really, I guess I just relaxed for a bit.	hit:3376_conv:6752_3_326
OK. I hope you are now fine?	hit:3376_conv:6752_4_329
Have you ever wish to switch places with your cat for a day or two?	hit:3380_conv:6761_1_326
Never. I hate cats personally	hit:3380_conv:6761_2_188
How about, dogs?	hit:3380_conv:6761_3_326
I've come to hate them too unfortunately. Constant noise	hit:3380_conv:6761_4_188
After the earthquake  I visited the old capitol, and saw still intact temples. 	hit:3381_conv:6762_1_326
Oh, that's so sad. What earthquake?	hit:3381_conv:6762_2_234
It was a 8.6 I believe, but it happened like 2 years ago.	hit:3381_conv:6762_3_326
Oh, that's a big one. I bet it caused a lot of damage	hit:3381_conv:6762_4_234
I watched a stray dog yesterday that had a lot of tick, I felt bad for her.	hit:3382_conv:6765_1_326
Aw that's so sad! Did you help it?	hit:3382_conv:6765_2_55
I didn't, I don't know why, maybe because I hate ticks.	hit:3382_conv:6765_3_326
I guess that's fair, but I probably would've taken it to the vet.	hit:3382_conv:6765_4_55
For some reason I never liked cloudy weather.	hit:3387_conv:6774_1_326
Me neither. It's why I hate living in London	hit:3387_conv:6774_2_188
Oh I don't know how you guys do it, you must have artificial sun at home?	hit:3387_conv:6774_3_326
Nope. We just remain miserable year round	hit:3387_conv:6774_4_188
I was listening to a guitar play the other day, and it made me cry a little.	hit:3390_conv:6781_1_326
Music can be so touching to the soul.	hit:3390_conv:6781_2_20
Yes, especially when you don't expect it to be.	hit:3390_conv:6781_3_326
Who was the artist of the song?	hit:3390_conv:6781_4_20
I had to get some incense few days ago, because my room smelled bad.	hit:3391_conv:6783_1_326
I like incense. Did you find the cause of the bad odor?	hit:3391_conv:6783_2_188
Yes, it some plumbing problems. 	hit:3391_conv:6783_3_326
Oh well I hope you can fix it soon	hit:3391_conv:6783_4_188
I realized a while ago, that it is good if you are not afraid of fear.	hit:3393_conv:6786_1_326
What made you realize that? You can't live in fear	hit:3393_conv:6786_2_188
Yes, but if you don't run away from it, there wont be any fear.	hit:3393_conv:6786_3_326
It's good to face your fears	hit:3393_conv:6786_4_188
I had some thought come into my mind, and they turned me red.	hit:3395_conv:6790_1_326
Oh was it a bad or naughty thought?	hit:3395_conv:6790_2_20
It was a crazy though actually, but thank god I didn't act on it.	hit:3395_conv:6790_3_326
What was it? Was it really that crazy?	hit:3395_conv:6790_4_20
We grew up fighting a lot with my sibling, but I still love them.	hit:3399_conv:6798_1_326
I think that happen in a lot of families.	hit:3399_conv:6798_2_7
Yes, you are right, but we still need to forgive.	hit:3399_conv:6798_3_326
I understand. You were the only one getting hit?	hit:3399_conv:6798_4_7
I was really pissed off when my brother ran my new car into a tree last month	hit:3446_conv:6892_1_391
ooh my God he hurt himself	hit:3446_conv:6892_2_268
Thankfully he did not. The tree was uprooted and the car really got damaged as well.	hit:3446_conv:6892_3_391
so bad i can imagine that loose he made to you	hit:3446_conv:6892_4_268
I was terrified when i watched the new conjuring movie!	hit:3448_conv:6896_1_391
how was it ?	hit:3448_conv:6896_2_238
It was really scary!	hit:3448_conv:6896_3_391
wow i can only imagine	hit:3448_conv:6896_4_238
I would like to believe our country would come together sooner or later	hit:3450_conv:6901_1_391
thats a good thought to have	hit:3450_conv:6901_2_238
Yeah, i mean.. We are all the children of the same nation.. time to stop the fight.	hit:3450_conv:6901_3_391

My granny walked in on me and my girlfriend the other day	hit:3453_conv:6907_1_391

It was really awkward though.. i mean,what do you do at that moment!	hit:3453_conv:6907_3_391
wait til she leaves and continue	hit:3453_conv:6907_4_238
I often am gone from my home and family for days or even weeks at a time.  I work on remote locations, looking for oil and gas.	hit:3454_conv:6908_1_339
Sounds like an interesting job.  I'm sure it's taxing on the family though.	hit:3454_conv:6908_2_447
It is difficult feeling isolated.  I miss them a lot.	hit:3454_conv:6908_3_339
In the end is the trade off worth it?	hit:3454_conv:6908_4_447
I don't really know, to be honest.  It pays our bills, and it is fun work, but it is hard.	hit:3454_conv:6908_5_339
I saw robert downey jr the other day.. such an awesome experience	hit:3456_conv:6912_1_391
I am so jealous. He is one of my all time favorite actors. 	hit:3456_conv:6912_2_226
He is so charming and electrifying in person as well.. such a nice guy	hit:3456_conv:6912_3_391

i was grossed out! i rushed off there immediately	hit:3457_conv:6915_3_391
I would have done the same as well	hit:3457_conv:6915_4_416
My phone company was billing me for stuff i did not use	hit:3458_conv:6917_1_391
Oh no.. I'm sure you did not feel great when you found out	hit:3458_conv:6917_2_416
I was extremely irritated actually	hit:3458_conv:6917_3_391
I would be too. Hopefully that gets resolved soon	hit:3458_conv:6917_4_416
I felt really good about myself when i stepped in for my interview last week	hit:3459_conv:6919_1_391

This is such an awesome coincidence buddy	hit:3465_conv:6930_4_416

I am sorry to hear that.  You weren't hurt were you?	hit:3469_conv:6939_2_274
I'm mostly okay. Just a little whiplash. I've never been in more than a fender bender before, so it was not a fun experience.	hit:3469_conv:6939_3_221
Were you at fault?	hit:3469_conv:6939_4_274
I always get a sense of pride watching my children	hit:3471_conv:6943_1_391
aww.. that is so sweet.. i bet every parent feel that way	hit:3471_conv:6943_2_416

that and much more! Especially if you choose to go and watch it alone at night	hit:3474_conv:6948_3_391

I was so grossed out when a friend of mine threw up on me	hit:3479_conv:6958_1_391

I gave my credit card for a stranger to use once	hit:3482_conv:6964_1_391
Why would you do that?	hit:3482_conv:6964_2_244
I felt sorry for the person, she looked trustworthy. and she needed to pay for some medicines for a friend who had accident	hit:3482_conv:6964_3_391
So, why didn't you just pay for them your self?	hit:3482_conv:6964_4_244
i felt so lonely in my new apartment	hit:3483_conv:6966_1_391
Sorry to hear that.. Why were you alone?	hit:3483_conv:6966_2_416
I have just moved away from my family to a new city for work. so.	hit:3483_conv:6966_3_391

The cops pulled me over, i thought something was wrong	hit:3488_conv:6976_3_391
Holy.. What did they want?	hit:3488_conv:6976_4_416
I wanted set all the ingredients at the cooking table before i cook last night	hit:3489_conv:6978_1_391

It is really good to have that level of discipline	hit:3489_conv:6978_4_416
I want the ingredients all on my table before i cook	hit:3490_conv:6981_1_391

There is something so nice about being prepared fully	hit:3490_conv:6981_3_391

I got so mad when i saw my brother ruining my favorite dress	hit:3507_conv:7014_1_391
Oh no, what did he do?	hit:3507_conv:7014_2_416
He cut animal shapes into it. When we were kids	hit:3507_conv:7014_3_391
Aww, you got to admit that is so cute as well	hit:3507_conv:7014_4_416

Such passion for cars. Wish you can buy one soon mate	hit:3510_conv:7021_4_416
A competing firm offered me a job for higher salary, if i cheated my firm. But i respectfully declined	hit:3515_conv:7031_1_391
How much better did it pay?	hit:3515_conv:7031_2_10
5k. But i am satisfied with my current firm	hit:3515_conv:7031_3_391
That is not too much, I think you made a good choice	hit:3515_conv:7031_4_10
I felt so lonely in Miami when i moved there from my family	hit:3522_conv:7044_1_391
Sorry to hear that my friend. Why did you move?	hit:3522_conv:7044_2_416
I got a new job in here, so.	hit:3522_conv:7044_3_391
I see.. Dont worry, you will own your new city soon enough	hit:3522_conv:7044_4_416
I felt so alone in my new city	hit:3523_conv:7047_1_391

Did you end up buying anything?	hit:3527_conv:7055_2_10

Well is it close to where you live? That would be cool to go back often	hit:3527_conv:7055_4_10
I always make sure to self assure myself before i go for an interview	hit:3528_conv:7057_1_391
that is a good tactic actually, it boosts your confidence	hit:3528_conv:7057_2_416
Yeah, and confidence is key in winning those right	hit:3528_conv:7057_3_391
Very true. We should believe in ourselves for others to do that	hit:3528_conv:7057_4_416
I was so terribly sad when my granny passed away..	hit:3532_conv:7064_1_391
Oh my god, sorry to hear that my friend.. Were you guys close?	hit:3532_conv:7064_2_416

When i get married i want to be like you , and take care of my loved one 	hit:3559_conv:7118_4_321
I gave a long, drawn out presentation at school the other day. I found the task to be very daunting.	hit:3565_conv:7131_1_250
That sounds tough.  How do you think you did?	hit:3565_conv:7131_2_451
Horrible, my palms were sweaty the entire time. I hate talking in front of large crowds.	hit:3565_conv:7131_3_250
Me, too--I'm sorrry you had to go through that.  At least it's over now, right?	hit:3565_conv:7131_4_451
My friend got accepted into Harvard University. That's my dream school. I don't understand how someone as dumb as him can get accepted there, and i'm stuck at community college.	hit:3570_conv:7140_1_250
Maybe they know a friend who knows a friend.	hit:3570_conv:7140_2_65
That's what i'm thinking, it's not what you know it's who you know.	hit:3570_conv:7140_3_250
Yep, that's the way of the world, especially with Universities to.	hit:3570_conv:7140_4_65
i recently ordered earphones online but i receive duplicate product	hit:3578_conv:7156_1_355
A duplicate? Like a fake?	hit:3578_conv:7156_2_244
yes i received a fake product , the make of earphones is very well known brand 	hit:3578_conv:7156_3_355
That  sucks.  I'd be very upset.      You have to be careful who you order from online.  Some times if the price is too goot to be true its a fake product.	hit:3578_conv:7156_4_244
yes that s true , i regularly buy online but this is the first time i experienced this.	hit:3578_conv:7156_5_355
I had the worst day ever yesterday.  I had just finished a long, hard day at work, I had driven the 40 minutes home, was just driving into my street and realised that I had left my bag with phone, purse and most importantly my house keys back in the office!	hit:3583_conv:7167_1_208
Oh no that is so frustrating! What did you do?	hit:3583_conv:7167_2_410
Well I wanted to cry and scream, I was so cross with myself but unfortunately as I live alone I just had to drive the 40 minutes back to the office to get them then another 40mins back home.  Where i swiftly had a little glass of wine to help lol.	hit:3583_conv:7167_3_208
Ah yes, a glass of wine might help to make that feel better. Still, what a pain. Lousy end to a lousy day. 	hit:3583_conv:7167_4_410
Exactly, so irritating.  But hey you live and learn, I guarantee you I will never leave work again without double then triple checking that I have all my belongings with me!	hit:3583_conv:7167_5_208
I would be so lost without my phone, but I could make it through an evening. The house keys though! 	hit:3583_conv:7167_6_410
I was shocked to see $200.00 included with the card.	hit:3586_conv:7172_1_147
Was it some fraudulent transaction posted on your account?	hit:3586_conv:7172_2_155
No not at all, She justed wanted to make sure I had a good birthday.	hit:3586_conv:7172_3_147
So, it was your partner who used you card	hit:3586_conv:7172_4_155
one month back i went for a wildlife safari , where i was attacked by a wild boar 	hit:3587_conv:7174_1_355
Oh no! Was anyone hurt?	hit:3587_conv:7174_2_244
ya i had bruises on my leg 	hit:3587_conv:7174_3_355
That's pretty scary.  Did the boar survive the ordeal?	hit:3587_conv:7174_4_244
it attacked me and ran into the bushes . it was a very bad experience.	hit:3587_conv:7174_5_355
Are you willing to go on another safari?	hit:3587_conv:7174_6_244
no i am done with such trips.	hit:3587_conv:7174_7_355
I'm not surprised.	hit:3587_conv:7174_8_244
My husbands brother was getting married.  I searched online and in every shop to find the perfect dress.  I finally found it, tried it on and loved it.  I couldnt buy it until the following week as I had to wait to payday so I left it over in the store.  The next day my sister in law called in.  She had been shopping and had also found the perfect dress.  She took it out of the bag to show me and I discovered it was the same dress!! Couldnt believe it.  Oh how I resented her at that moment.	hit:3593_conv:7187_1_208
That's very intense. I am sorry you had to experience that.	hit:3593_conv:7187_2_64
Oh if envy could kill - she would have been dead on the spot.  Needless to say I got over it and found another dress but just at that moment on that day...	hit:3593_conv:7187_3_208
That's good. Time heals all wounds and can be a powerful cure to pain and disdain.	hit:3593_conv:7187_4_64
Indeed.  I had to take a reality check.  Afterall the day wasnt about me, it was about the bride and groom lol.	hit:3593_conv:7187_5_208
I never can get myself to give away their baby items. 	hit:3597_conv:7195_1_147
You are telling me you are a hoarder?	hit:3597_conv:7195_2_75
lol no I just can't part with items that mean a lot to me like my kids baby things like first shirts ect.	hit:3597_conv:7195_3_147
Everyone is nostalgic one way or another.You are fine	hit:3597_conv:7195_4_75
I was walking down the street yesterday in my brand new summer dress.  I though i was gorgeous! Suddenly a big gust of wind came and blew my dress up around my ears! Where I succeeded in flashing my underwear to the entire street.  Oh the embarrassment.	hit:3603_conv:7207_1_208
Oh my goodness! Thats terrible. Did anyone see? My face would be bright red.	hit:3603_conv:7207_2_452
Oh my face was very red indeed and yes unfortunately I got a hugh cheer from a group of lads who witnessed it all.  I was so mortified I just ran home.  Later though I chatted about it with my friends and was finally able to laugh about it.	hit:3603_conv:7207_3_208
I'm sure this will be one of those times where you cringe when you think back on it! I'm sure you made those guy's days though	hit:3603_conv:7207_4_452
haha thats how I am trying to look at it.  Trying to see the funny side.  I have learnt my lesson about that dress though.  I think i will just put it back in the wardrobe and leave it there!	hit:3603_conv:7207_5_208
I so get how you feel because I decided to watch Insidious the other night on my own.  I scared the life out of myself afterwards because I thought I kept seeing shadows and hearing noises and had myself convinced someone or something was in the house with me!	hit:3611_conv:7223_1_208
That's crazy! I'm glad there was nothing there.	hit:3611_conv:7223_2_64
Oh no just my vivid imagination lol.  I do love a good horror but usually I watch them with my husband.  I am clearly not as brave on my own!!	hit:3611_conv:7223_3_208
Some horror movies are so great that they make you consider your own environment.	hit:3611_conv:7223_4_64
You are right there.  Nothing better than a good film in general but horrors can really evoke such reactions from them.	hit:3611_conv:7223_5_208
I helped a doctor's assistant over a couple of months	hit:3613_conv:7227_1_417
That's great. I bet it was wonderful experience.	hit:3613_conv:7227_2_64
It was she wasn't really good ans i had no problem helping	hit:3613_conv:7227_3_417
That's cool. Taking that experience into the next phase will be pivotal.	hit:3613_conv:7227_4_64
Yes!! They didn't forget me at Christmas 	hit:3613_conv:7227_5_417
my car had a small accident recently	hit:3618_conv:7237_1_355
I am sorry to hear that.Did you get hurt.	hit:3618_conv:7237_2_75
no it was a minor accident , but car got damaged little	hit:3618_conv:7237_3_355
Do you have full cover?	hit:3618_conv:7237_4_75
yes , but when i went for claim insurance company terms made me feel helpless.	hit:3618_conv:7237_5_355
I never did find out why there were so many police cars there today.	hit:3622_conv:7244_1_147
Where did this happen?! Were there any other people with you?	hit:3622_conv:7244_2_456
In town, I had my kids with me to buy school supplies.	hit:3622_conv:7244_3_147
Did it happen while you were in the store? I hope that your kids did not see anything too disturbing.	hit:3622_conv:7244_4_456
I found my old high school yearbooks that other day. 	hit:3626_conv:7253_1_462
Oh that is pretty cool. What did you think?	hit:3626_conv:7253_2_139
I think that I didn't appreciate not having to worry about adult stuff back then! 	hit:3626_conv:7253_3_462
Yeah, we were blissfully unaware of the real world in those days. It must have been nice to reminisce.	hit:3626_conv:7253_4_139
It was. It was also crazy to see the 1980s hairstyles. So.much.hairspray.	hit:3626_conv:7253_5_462
I am feel pretty mucky things have been pretty stable at home.	hit:3631_conv:7262_1_147
That has got to feel good!  You must feel very happy and relaxed!	hit:3631_conv:7262_2_277
Yes I am and thankful since I have 3 young kids at home, 	hit:3631_conv:7262_3_147
Cherish this time you have, because you never know when it could change!	hit:3631_conv:7262_4_277
I got a gift card to a restaurant I've been wanting to try for a long time. 	hit:3636_conv:7273_1_462
What restaurant is it for? 	hit:3636_conv:7273_2_269
It's a local non-chain Greek restaurant. It's fancy and supposed to be very good. 	hit:3636_conv:7273_3_462
Sounds good. I love mom n pop restaurants. So much better than big popular restaurants.	hit:3636_conv:7273_4_269
Yes. Almost always better!	hit:3636_conv:7273_5_462
I went on a blind date last week. Honestly, I didn't know what to expect at first.	hit:3638_conv:7276_1_250
That sounds really interesting. Were there any good matches?	hit:3638_conv:7276_2_139
It was alright, but it was hard to find common ground at first.	hit:3638_conv:7276_3_250
Well at least you are putting yourself out there. A lot of people give up on finding love.	hit:3638_conv:7276_4_139
I have a dentist appointment tomorrow. I think I have a cavity.	hit:3639_conv:7279_1_462
Oh no, I hate cavities. Are you brushing your teeth eVeryday?	hit:3639_conv:7279_2_269
Yes, but I think I'm genetically hosed when it comes to teeth. I really hate it. 	hit:3639_conv:7279_3_462
Dang, that sucks. I hope you can find a solution for that	hit:3639_conv:7279_4_269
My son scored a perfect 1600 on the SATs!!	hit:3646_conv:7292_1_462
Wow, you must be proud! He might cure cancer next!	hit:3646_conv:7292_2_250
I am proud. And he may eventually cure cancer, but I'd settle right now for him cleaning his room!	hit:3646_conv:7292_3_462
Geniuses don't do chores my friend.	hit:3646_conv:7292_4_250
I went to my moms funeral yesterday, but surprisingly I wasn't sad at all. I was at peace because she accomplished a lot during her time here on earth.	hit:3646_conv:7293_1_250
I'm so sorry to hear about your mom. It's good that you're at peace with it, though. 	hit:3646_conv:7293_2_462
Yeah, she's in a better place now.	hit:3646_conv:7293_3_250
But a part of her is still here in you. 	hit:3646_conv:7293_4_462
My husband and sons left town for weekend. 	hit:3650_conv:7301_1_462
They left you all alone? I bet you feel lonely...	hit:3650_conv:7301_2_269
Yeah, it was cool for a while, but the house is way to quiet now	hit:3650_conv:7301_3_462
I know that feeling. I like to keep the TV on to drown out the silence	hit:3650_conv:7301_4_269
So, I bought myself a box strawberry frosted pop tarts last week. Today I went to go have one for breakfast...GONE! 	hit:3654_conv:7309_1_462
Whoever ate it all is evil!!!	hit:3654_conv:7309_2_269
I need to interrogate everyone in this house. I'm so angry. You don't mess with Mom's Pop Tarts!	hit:3654_conv:7309_3_462
I know right. I would be so furious!	hit:3654_conv:7309_4_269
My neighbor was having a party last night and wouldn't let me sleep. I felt like going out there and giving him a piece of my mind!	hit:3657_conv:7315_1_250
I would do it! Try to be calm about it at first and see how he responds.	hit:3657_conv:7315_2_286
No, next time I might snap. They never show any consideration for anybody on the block. They do whatever they want.	hit:3657_conv:7315_3_250
Yeah, something should be done about it!	hit:3657_conv:7315_4_286
My friend wanted to go to lunch today. I told her I was busy, but really I just didn't want to go...	hit:3658_conv:7317_1_462
I've done that before when I was just annoyed with them. Don't feel bad!	hit:3658_conv:7317_2_269
Well, I do feel a little guilty, just sitting here on my couch watching tv	hit:3658_conv:7317_3_462
Who cares! I always like to think of satisfying myself first before others!	hit:3658_conv:7317_4_269
So...the sewer line backed up into our house last week. 	hit:3662_conv:7324_1_462
Oh no! That's a smelly situation to be in. What did you end up doing to fix it?	hit:3662_conv:7324_2_466
It was truly disgusting. We had to have a crew of plumbers come in and dig up our yard.	hit:3662_conv:7324_3_462
What a pain! I bet that cost a fortune. Did they end up repairing all the portions of yard that they had to rip up?	hit:3662_conv:7324_4_466
My brother got out of prison yesterday! It felt so good to see him after such a long time.	hit:3668_conv:7336_1_250
That must have been a great reunion! Who was happier, him or you?	hit:3668_conv:7336_2_462
Definitely me, I gave him a big bear hug when he walked out those gates.	hit:3668_conv:7336_3_250
He was lucky to have you waiting there for him!	hit:3668_conv:7336_4_462
The transmission in my car died last week. Such an expensive repair	hit:3668_conv:7337_1_462
Ugh, I hate when unexpected expenses arise.	hit:3668_conv:7337_2_250
Fortunately, my parents offered to loan me the money to fix it. 	hit:3668_conv:7337_3_462
Well, that was nice of them. I hope you take them out to dinner after you pay them back.	hit:3668_conv:7337_4_250
My friend and I both did a low-carb diet last month. She lost 8 pounds. I gained 2! 	hit:3678_conv:7356_1_462
Wow, great for her! I am confused as to how you ended up GAINING though!	hit:3678_conv:7356_2_466
I dunno. Water weight? She looks so good now. I'm really envious. 	hit:3678_conv:7356_3_462
Well, keep at it and you will get where you want to be. It really just comes down to how many calories you take in vs. how many calories you burn per day.	hit:3678_conv:7356_4_466
On a whim today, I bought a scratch off card at 7/11	hit:3682_conv:7364_1_462
Please tell me you won a lot of money.	hit:3682_conv:7364_2_250
Not a lot - $100. But that's $100 more than I had when I woke up this morning. I was so surprised I did one of those annoying girly squeals at the check out counter	hit:3682_conv:7364_3_462
lol That's how I would of reacted too. One hundred dollars can buy you a lot of stuff.	hit:3682_conv:7364_4_250
My kids spilled juice on my brand new white carpet. I told them not to brink food, or drinks in the living room. When will they learn?	hit:3682_conv:7365_1_250
OH NO! That's infuriating. Did the stain come out?	hit:3682_conv:7365_2_462
Yes, but I had to spend extra money to get the carpet shampooed. I gave them a spanking that they will never forget. I'm not putting up with this no more.	hit:3682_conv:7365_3_250
Hopefully they remember	hit:3682_conv:7365_4_462
I had a salad for lunch yesterday, then went shopping at the mall. When I got home around 7pm I discovered I had a HUGE piece of spinach between my front teeth!	hit:3687_conv:7374_1_462
Did you brush it right out?	hit:3687_conv:7374_2_291
I did. But dozen of people had already seen it. I was mortified. No one told me!	hit:3687_conv:7374_3_462
Maybe you could give them a call on the phone and tell them about your feelings?	hit:3687_conv:7374_4_291
My friend invited me to a pool party, but I don't know how to swim. I told her I would think about it.	hit:3691_conv:7383_1_250
You could go to the party. And then learn how to swim!	hit:3691_conv:7383_2_291
I'm not sure, I might just stay in the shallow part of the pool.	hit:3691_conv:7383_3_250
Yea, and you can bring some water toys to play with!	hit:3691_conv:7383_4_291
I went to a wedding this weekend. I've recently lost a ton of weight so I bought a new dress for the occassion. 	hit:3692_conv:7384_1_462
Awesome! I bet you felt proud at what you accomplished. Did you have this goal in mind for a while?	hit:3692_conv:7384_2_466
Yes. I've wanted to be healthier, but I also wanted to look hot and feel confident at this event. 	hit:3692_conv:7384_3_462
How much total weight did you lose, and how long did it take?	hit:3692_conv:7384_4_466
I'm leaving for vacation on Wednesday!	hit:3696_conv:7392_1_462
Thats awesome.  I wish I could go.  Where are you going?	hit:3696_conv:7392_2_301
On a cruise to Havana. I'm so excited!	hit:3696_conv:7392_3_462
Cruises are awesome.  You get to eat as much food as you want.  You'll probably put on like 10 pounds	hit:3696_conv:7392_4_301
I got caught in a huge rainstorm last week. It was a deludge. 	hit:3702_conv:7404_1_462
Aww man, I hope you brought your raincoat.	hit:3702_conv:7404_2_250
Thankfully I had remembered to put an umbrella in my bag before I left the house. 	hit:3702_conv:7404_3_462
That's good, you don't want to get soaked and catch a cold.	hit:3702_conv:7404_4_250
My brother in the army showed up at my football event yesterday. I wasn't expecting him to come. I thought he was still stationed in Iraq.	hit:3702_conv:7405_1_250
That's amazing. You must have been so surprised and happy!	hit:3702_conv:7405_2_462
Totally, I was in shock.	hit:3702_conv:7405_3_250
Did you get a video of it?	hit:3702_conv:7405_4_462
Once, at a Waffle House near Memphis, I heard a man order 15 eggs over-easy. 	hit:3706_conv:7412_1_462
Gee, he must have been really hungry! That's a lot of eggs!	hit:3706_conv:7412_2_469
I stayed to watch to see if he'd eat them all. He did. I was very impressed.	hit:3706_conv:7412_3_462
Wow.. that's unbelievable. I wonder how his cholesterol is. 	hit:3706_conv:7412_4_469
TSA made me pull down my pants in front of everybody at the airport yesterday. They thought I was a bomb threat.	hit:3710_conv:7421_1_250
Oh dang, that really sucks. I can't believe TSA would go that far, it must've been super embarrassing. 	hit:3710_conv:7421_2_470
Yeah, I will never show my face there again.	hit:3710_conv:7421_3_250
Dude, you should definitely report it someone or the company because you could probably get something out of it.	hit:3710_conv:7421_4_470
I rode the largest roller coaster I've ever ridden this summer. 	hit:3711_conv:7423_1_462
Oh yeah, what was it called? I really love roller coasters!	hit:3711_conv:7423_2_139
Millenium Force, in Cedar Point. It was utterly terrifying. 	hit:3711_conv:7423_3_462
I saw that one on TV. It looks absolutely nuts. I hope to visit Cedar Point one day!	hit:3711_conv:7423_4_139
I'm waiting to hear back from a few colleges about scholarships.	hit:3714_conv:7428_1_462
Oh, I hope you get some good news. I am sure it would help you getting aid for college.	hit:3714_conv:7428_2_139
Yes, I think my stats are good. I'm hopeful there will be some good news soon.	hit:3714_conv:7428_3_462
All you can do is be patient and see what happens. I am sure everything will work out for you.	hit:3714_conv:7428_4_139
My best friend is getting married next weekend. I'm in the wedding. 	hit:3718_conv:7436_1_462
That's awesome. I hope it works out for your friend and their fiancee. Are you excited to be there?	hit:3718_conv:7436_2_139
Super excited! These two have been together forever. It's about time they made it legit!	hit:3718_conv:7436_3_462
Well I am sure they appreciate you being a part of their big day. Enjoy the after party!	hit:3718_conv:7436_4_139
I went to a fancy art showing at a gallery last night.	hit:3726_conv:7452_1_462
Wow, that sounds fun. What type of artwork did you see?	hit:3726_conv:7452_2_469
It was watercolors. My neighbor was the artist. I had no idea she did such great work. She also has two toddlers. I have no idea how she manages all of that.	hit:3726_conv:7452_3_462
Gee, she must have her hands full! I hope she does well as an artist!	hit:3726_conv:7452_4_469
I thought I could lift, but my wife upstaged me by benching 150 lbs at the gym the other day. I can only lift 130 lbs.	hit:3727_conv:7455_1_250
Did you feel very emasculated by this?	hit:3727_conv:7455_2_466
No, it actually turned me on. I didn't know she was that strong.	hit:3727_conv:7455_3_250
Yeah, I can see that viewpoint as well. She may end up carrying you to bed next time!	hit:3727_conv:7455_4_466
My son came back from a camping trip last night. I was great to have him safely home again. 	hit:3730_conv:7461_1_462
I'm glad he returned home safe and sound. Did he have fun on the camping trip?	hit:3730_conv:7461_2_471
He did. I'm a worrier, but I need to learn to let go more. 	hit:3730_conv:7461_3_462
My mom was the same way. It's all part of being a parent. I hope to have kids soon too and I worry about stuff concerning them myself!	hit:3730_conv:7461_4_471
I came across my wedding albums the other day and showed them to my kids.	hit:3733_conv:7466_1_462
Oh wow, I bet the emotions of that came back to you.	hit:3733_conv:7466_2_250
Yes, it was so much fun to see the younger version of me and my husband, pre-kids. Very sentimental.	hit:3733_conv:7466_3_462
Yes, those memories are what make life so special.	hit:3733_conv:7466_4_250
I got a car for my birthday, but I kinda knew I was going to get it beforehand because I kept telling my wife I wanted it.	hit:3733_conv:7467_1_250
So, not a surprise, but still nice to get? 	hit:3733_conv:7467_2_462
Yeah, kind of ruined the surprise, but I can always count on my wife to make me feel special.	hit:3733_conv:7467_3_250
That's sweet. 	hit:3733_conv:7467_4_462
I donated $1,000 to the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. It's for a great cause that's very important to me.	hit:3738_conv:7477_1_250
Wow, thats very admirable of you.  People who abuse animals are the worst kind of people.	hit:3738_conv:7477_2_301
I agree, we should protect and nurture animals, not abuse them. 	hit:3738_conv:7477_3_250
I have 2 dogs myself and I could never imagine hurting them.  I can't believe there are people out there who think that that is ok. its sick.	hit:3738_conv:7477_4_301
i miss my childhood and living with my parents	hit:3739_conv:7478_1_327
Yeah those were the days. When we had no worries in the world.	hit:3739_conv:7478_2_139
yes indeed.  i wish i had my treehouse back that my dad built for me.  i would live in it.	hit:3739_conv:7478_3_327
That sounds really cool. I always wanted a treehouse but never had a good tree for it.	hit:3739_conv:7478_4_139
i grew up in the country, it was a great place to grow up.	hit:3739_conv:7478_5_327
i live next to a football field and every football season i hate living here	hit:3742_conv:7485_1_327
Oh yeah, why is that?	hit:3742_conv:7485_2_53
Because they park in my driveway!	hit:3742_conv:7485_3_327
I would have them towed!	hit:3742_conv:7485_4_53
i have signs up this year, so i can do that legally!	hit:3742_conv:7485_5_327
Oh so you have to have a sign up to legally tow them?	hit:3742_conv:7485_6_53
Yes. Which i think is wrong.  If they are on my property i should have the right without the sign.	hit:3742_conv:7485_7_327
Or you could just park behind them so that they would have to knock on your door before you let them out.	hit:3742_conv:7485_8_53
my husband treated me to a week at disney, i had no idea!	hit:3744_conv:7488_1_327
That's awesome. Which Disney park did you go to?	hit:3744_conv:7488_2_139
disney world. it's the only one Ive ever been to .	hit:3744_conv:7488_3_327
Ooh I live pretty close to it. You have a great husband to give you that treat!	hit:3744_conv:7488_4_139
Oh my, you must be there every day then!	hit:3744_conv:7488_5_327
i am pretty happy right now, i don't think i have ever been happier with my life.	hit:3748_conv:7496_1_327
That's good that you found happiness. That's what were all in the pursuit of right?	hit:3748_conv:7496_2_250
Exactly! I used to struggle but i don't anymore	hit:3748_conv:7496_3_327
You are blessed. Make sure to spread the positive energy. 	hit:3748_conv:7496_4_250
I do every chance i get, and thank you!	hit:3748_conv:7496_5_327
My daughter went out of town, but she promised me she wouldn't do anything I wouldn't approve of, and I believe her, so I let her go.	hit:3748_conv:7497_1_250
that's great that you can trust her.  how old?	hit:3748_conv:7497_2_327
Yeah, she's a good kid and hasn't given me any reason to think otherwise. She just turned 18.	hit:3748_conv:7497_3_250
That's great. Be thankful, some people aren't so lucky.	hit:3748_conv:7497_4_327
Man I can't believe I almost bought that thing at Walmart!	hit:3750_conv:7500_1_132
what did you almost buy?	hit:3750_conv:7500_2_327
It was a combination rice-cooker and vegetable steamer.  It looked so good in the ad, but when I got there, it looked cheap and shabby!	hit:3750_conv:7500_3_132
It's hard to find good quality at walmart	hit:3750_conv:7500_4_327
I hope I can find one that lives up to the promise of that ad.  Maybe somwhere else, right?	hit:3750_conv:7500_5_132
I would try target.  good quality stuff there.	hit:3750_conv:7500_6_327
I could try online, but I'd have to buy it first and then see if it's good quality.	hit:3750_conv:7500_7_132
try googling it, and read thru the reviews	hit:3750_conv:7500_8_327
i am trying to sell my house, i hope i can find a buyer	hit:3750_conv:7501_1_327
Finding a buyer can be tough.  You have a good agent?	hit:3750_conv:7501_2_132
I hope i do.  We will see, I know it can take a while.\	hit:3750_conv:7501_3_327
Does it have a good location?  You know the only rule of real estate, right?  Location, Location, Location.	hit:3750_conv:7501_4_132
yes i live behind a school.	hit:3750_conv:7501_5_327
Sounds good.  Definitely should target a family buyer then	hit:3750_conv:7501_6_132
yes, but i will leave that to the listing agent.	hit:3750_conv:7501_7_327
You got a figure in mind for your house or are you letting the agent handle that as well?	hit:3750_conv:7501_8_132
I had to leave my last job because this manager they brought in was such an incompetent doofus.	hit:3753_conv:7507_1_473
Thats never good when you have a bad manager.  What made them so bad?	hit:3753_conv:7507_2_301
"He was the ""marketing manager"" but couldn't market his way out of a paper bag, it was impossible to work with him. Plus he thought he knew everything which made it worse."	hit:3753_conv:7507_3_473
Know it alls are the worst.  Hopefully you are in a better spot now, with a manager who cares.	hit:3753_conv:7507_4_301
I am actually, thank you for caring!	hit:3753_conv:7507_5_473
i am concerned about my father	hit:3755_conv:7511_1_327
Oh no! What's wrong with your dad?	hit:3755_conv:7511_2_104
he is old, and he lives alone.  i just worry because he is getting old.  he gets on ok, but i don't know how much longer.	hit:3755_conv:7511_3_327
Aw, I'm so sorry to hear that. It's not easy to watch our parents age. 	hit:3755_conv:7511_4_104
no it's not, but hopefully our kids will do the same for us some day.	hit:3755_conv:7511_5_327
We can surely hope! 	hit:3755_conv:7511_6_104
My neighbor asked me to watch over his dog. I told him he could trust me, but he escaped and ran away.	hit:3758_conv:7516_1_250
That must have made you feel terrible. Were you able to find the dog?	hit:3758_conv:7516_2_473
I feel so bad. I forgot to lock the gate. No, but I put up a lot of posters, so hopefully I find him before my neighbor comes back.	hit:3758_conv:7516_3_250
I sincerely hope you can find him! But I bet your neighbor will understand it was just a mistake and you didn't do it on purpose.	hit:3758_conv:7516_4_473
I used to have this obnoxious neighbor who stayed up all night playing League of Legends, he drove me nuts screaming into his headset all hours of the day and night.	hit:3758_conv:7517_1_473
Doesn't he understand that people have to go to work in the morning?	hit:3758_conv:7517_2_250
His parents paid his bills so no, he didn't understand that sadly. I tried talking to him about it but clearly he didn't get the picture as he kept doing it.	hit:3758_conv:7517_3_473
You might have to file a noise complaint with the police.	hit:3758_conv:7517_4_250
i have a new job offer, but im not sure if i should take it	hit:3761_conv:7522_1_327
What is causing you to question whether it's the right thing for you or not?	hit:3761_conv:7522_2_56
well, it is retail.  ive done retail and it is not fun.	hit:3761_conv:7522_3_327
Yeah, I've done that as well.  It can definitely be a hard job, considering dealing with the public, hours during holiday seasons, etc.. But sometimes if the pay is good, it can outweigh some of the negatives.	hit:3761_conv:7522_4_56
that's true. i don't like dealing with people.	hit:3761_conv:7522_5_327
So this one time I walked in on my cat using the toilet by himself. He just taught himself to do it, I had no idea how or why but it was pretty cool.	hit:3763_conv:7527_1_473
lol that remind me of a movie i saw with robert deniro , thats absolutly bizzare by the way but cool at the same time	hit:3763_conv:7527_2_321
I know which movie you're talking about! I think they actually had to train that cat to do it. Mine just... learned.	hit:3763_conv:7527_3_473
wow , i would love to have a cat like yours 	hit:3763_conv:7527_4_321
I went to a concert by myself because all my friends were too busy doing other things.	hit:3765_conv:7531_1_250
Aww thats too bad that no one else could go.  What concert was it?	hit:3765_conv:7531_2_301
It was a Marilyn Manson concert. I was even dancing by myself.	hit:3765_conv:7531_3_250
haha that must have been a crazy concert! 	hit:3765_conv:7531_4_301
This friend of mine is constantly job hopping, I don't even know what she does technically but she seems to get good jobs so easily, whereas when I left my last job I could barely get interviews.	hit:3768_conv:7537_1_473
Sometimes that depends on the industry. If she works in ones that have high turnover it's not a big of a deal as, say, an administrative job	hit:3768_conv:7537_2_234
She's in banking so there are definitely a lot of available jobs. And there seems to be a lot of turnover so you're probably right.	hit:3768_conv:7537_3_473
Well, I'm not entirely sure about the banking side but I wonder what she's looking for. Perhaps a small vs big bank culture	hit:3768_conv:7537_4_234
I am ready to start renovating the rest of my house.	hit:3770_conv:7541_1_327
OOO I love doing that, but not so much the upheaval in the midst of it.  What room are you going to be working on?	hit:3770_conv:7541_2_56
I finished my kitchen, so the next room is going to be my family room.  Just painting it really. 	hit:3770_conv:7541_3_327
Still, a new color can definitely brighten up a space and make it feel all new!	hit:3770_conv:7541_4_56
Oh yes, we haven't decided on the color yet.	hit:3770_conv:7541_5_327
This morning I woke up and I was in such a good mood that I just started singing in the shower.	hit:3774_conv:7549_1_250
That's awesome!  I wish I could wake up that way every morning.  Did something specific make you feel that way?	hit:3774_conv:7549_2_56
I don't know, I think it was because I had a dream about marrying Scarlett Johansson.	hit:3774_conv:7549_3_250
Ha!!  Well I've woken up from a dream and been mad at my husband because of something he did in my dream - I guess it can go the other way too!	hit:3774_conv:7549_4_56
I went through my closet the other day and found all these old writings and drawings I did when I was in elementary school. It was fun remembering being that little, how different the world was.	hit:3778_conv:7556_1_473
I've done that before... I enjoyed it too! I love looking back at old pictures and stuff	hit:3778_conv:7556_2_397
Did your parents save a lot of your school work like mine did? I'm surprised how much my mom kept!	hit:3778_conv:7556_3_473
Some of it but my grandma did save a lot.  I plan on doing that with my kids	hit:3778_conv:7556_4_397
For my birthday last year, a coworker gave me cheese. It sounds ridiculous but I was touched by her thoughtfulness. I love cheese!	hit:3782_conv:7564_1_473
I love cheese too! What kind of cheese was it?	hit:3782_conv:7564_2_235
Smoked gouda, one of my favorites! I ate it all in a day haha	hit:3782_conv:7564_3_473
Gouda is great! Do you like prosciutto too?	hit:3782_conv:7564_4_235
YES. Basically anything meat and cheese and I am totally there!	hit:3782_conv:7564_5_473
My cat had really bad breath so I took her in to the dentist. It turned out almost all of her teeth needed to be pulled, poor thing was in so much pain.	hit:3785_conv:7570_1_473
Aww poor baby, hopefully shes doing fine now.	hit:3785_conv:7570_2_250
She's doing great, thanks! It was a tough recovery for a few days but then you could tell she felt SO much better.	hit:3785_conv:7570_3_473
That's great to hear. You have one tough cat.	hit:3785_conv:7570_4_250
When I was a kid, I remember telling my mom to take me to McDonald's, just so I could get the toy in my Happy Meal. I didn't even care about the food.	hit:3785_conv:7571_1_250
Ha, I used to do that too. But I was almost always disappointed by the toy once I actually got it.	hit:3785_conv:7571_2_473
Right? but when you collected them all there was no greater feeling.	hit:3785_conv:7571_3_250
True! McDonald's was my first job when I was 14 and I remember being stoked I could now collect ALL the toys even if I didn't play with them!	hit:3785_conv:7571_4_473
I'm so nervous. I had a job interview the other day and haven't heard back yet.	hit:3787_conv:7575_1_430
Did they tell you when you may hear back from them?	hit:3787_conv:7575_2_56
They said within the week, I know it's only been a few days but I'm excited about the opportunity!	hit:3787_conv:7575_3_430
I pray they get in touch with you soon and that's is an affirmative on the job!  I know  how nerve-wracking waiting can be though - I hope you get it!	hit:3787_conv:7575_4_56
Unfortunately, I accidentally sent an email to a coworker essentially complaining about her attitude. I really wanted to dig myself in a hole and never come out.	hit:3790_conv:7581_1_347
Arghhhhhhhhh! I soooo feel for you and have been there. Have y'all had the chance to talk about it? (Or do you even want to?)	hit:3790_conv:7581_2_66
I've kind of avoided her a bit. I'm trying to come up with an apology that feels heartfelt. It's a horrible feeling!	hit:3790_conv:7581_3_347
"I hear you. Maybe humor might help? Like ""okay, so *this* is awkward....can we talk about that email?"" Heartfelt apologies go a long way, and even if she doesn't respond -- you'll feel better for trying."	hit:3790_conv:7581_4_66
I went to a restaurant and the waitress put things on our bill that I did not order. 	hit:3793_conv:7586_1_475
Are you sure they didnt bring the wrong bill?	hit:3793_conv:7586_2_278
It had everything we ordered plus a couple things at the bottom we didn't order.	hit:3793_conv:7586_3_475
I would have complained.	hit:3793_conv:7586_4_278
Oh, I did, she immediately said ok I'll take it off like it happened all the time. Made me think it was done on purpose just to see if I  wouldn't notice.	hit:3793_conv:7586_5_475
Since most of my family is either dead or lives a few states away, I usually spend Thanksgiving alone. It sucks sometimes.	hit:3796_conv:7593_1_473
Ohh, I feel sorry for you	hit:3796_conv:7593_2_261
Oh don't feel bad, I live a lovely life and have many friends. It's just that they usually go home to their own families that time of year.	hit:3796_conv:7593_3_473
Ohh, that's bad. You can always skype your family!	hit:3796_conv:7593_4_261
I spent the entire other weekend cleaning my apartment. It sucked at the time but it was so nice when I was done to just chill out and watch TV.	hit:3800_conv:7601_1_473
Yes, I feel you. Cleaning sucks, but after all that hard work, the results are amazing!	hit:3800_conv:7601_2_261
Right? It's so rewarding when you're finished and everything smells good. I love that feeling.	hit:3800_conv:7601_3_473
Me too! You seem just like me!	hit:3800_conv:7601_4_261
My husband and I closed on our first house last week!	hit:3802_conv:7604_1_430
That sounds very exciting! What kind of planning did you put into such an achievement?	hit:3802_conv:7604_2_453
It is! Lots of blood, sweat and tears - and lots of phone calls and signing things, haha. We can't wait to move in!	hit:3802_conv:7604_3_430
That's so cool! I wish you the very best and hope that the blood sweat and tears turns into happiness, joy and fun times!	hit:3802_conv:7604_4_453
my daughter moved to California and a few months later she got in a car accident and was on the other side of the country so there was nothing I could immediately do.	hit:3805_conv:7611_1_475
Are there any other family members out there that could help her?	hit:3805_conv:7611_2_456
No. She asked her friend to call me after it happened but wasn't able to tell me many details.	hit:3805_conv:7611_3_475
Wow, I hope that she was able to work things out. Not the best way to start living somewhere far from home, but I'm sure she figured something out.	hit:3805_conv:7611_4_456
They took her to the hospital for evaluation but she ended up just being a bit bruised up. I was worried something like this would happen. Everything did work out in the end though.	hit:3805_conv:7611_5_475
Recently I was contacted by my former company, begging to get me back. I felt really good about the salary negotiation since I knew they needed me.	hit:3806_conv:7612_1_473
That's great! I am happy for you!	hit:3806_conv:7612_2_261
Thanks, I'm happy about it. I only have to work a few hours a week, it's pretty amazing.	hit:3806_conv:7612_3_473
Yeah, and they are paying you good enough. You are a luckiest person!	hit:3806_conv:7612_4_261
i was shocked to learn that i had been called to serve on a jury !	hit:3808_conv:7617_1_327
i honestly have never gone to jury duty , but im sure it was still a pain to put it on your schedule 	hit:3808_conv:7617_2_321
yes i am not looking forward to it.  ive heard that its just awful.	hit:3808_conv:7617_3_327
same thing i heard too , really long and boring being there against your will 	hit:3808_conv:7617_4_321
yes i think it is going to be a long week or so.	hit:3808_conv:7617_5_327
My dog died this past December and I've had a really hard time getting over it. She was our family pet.	hit:3810_conv:7621_1_347
I am so sorry to hear that. I have been devastated by the loss of pets in the past, so I can understand what you're going through. I'm sure she was very loved and had a great life with you and your family.	hit:3810_conv:7621_2_292
She really was a wonderful pet. We just got a puppy recently, which is the same breed as the one who passed away. She's bringing some light back into our lives. 	hit:3810_conv:7621_3_347
Aww that's great! What breed? 	hit:3810_conv:7621_4_292
The worst day of my life was when I was 8 months pregnant with our first child and I started bleeding like crazy.	hit:3811_conv:7623_1_430
Oh no! that sounds so scary. was everything ok?	hit:3811_conv:7623_2_301
Yes, thankfully everything turned out fine. I had to spend 3 weeks in the hospital though!	hit:3811_conv:7623_3_430
Good I'm glad to hear that.  That's a long time.  Hospitals scare me, I can't imagine being there for that long	hit:3811_conv:7623_4_301
my doggie recently passed away	hit:3812_conv:7624_1_327
I'm so sorry to hear that! Hopefully he or she wasn't in too much pain at the end.	hit:3812_conv:7624_2_473
no i don't think so, but it was violent.  she was run over by a car.  	hit:3812_conv:7624_3_327
Oh my gosh that's horrible. I hope they caught the person who hit her!	hit:3812_conv:7624_4_473
i don't think i will ever know. they usually don't stop when that happens.	hit:3812_conv:7624_5_327
The other day I woke up and without looking I stepped in warm cat vomit.	hit:3812_conv:7625_1_473
oh man, that's gross! at least it was vomit and not something else.	hit:3812_conv:7625_2_327
Yeah it was pretty gross but one of my cats is pretty pukey, I should have known better and watched where I was walking.	hit:3812_conv:7625_3_473
how many cats do have?	hit:3812_conv:7625_4_327
Well right now I have six but they're not all mine, I foster for a cat rescue. Three are mine, three are for adoption. It gets crazy in my house!	hit:3812_conv:7625_5_473
My dog died last year. 	hit:3817_conv:7634_1_475
Aw, I am so sorry. How long did you have your dog for?	hit:3817_conv:7634_2_387
About 5 years. He was a rescue.	hit:3817_conv:7634_3_475
They say dogs are mans best friend. 	hit:3817_conv:7634_4_387
That's true. He was definitely mine.	hit:3817_conv:7634_5_475
What kind of dog was he?	hit:3817_conv:7634_6_387
He was a pit and lab mix.	hit:3817_conv:7634_7_475
Nice, I have an australian shepherd. He follows me around everywhere. 	hit:3817_conv:7634_8_387
The worst phone call I ever got in my life was when I was told my dad only had a few weeks left to live.	hit:3818_conv:7637_1_430
Oh no. That's terrible. I lost my dad five years ago, I know how terrible that feels.	hit:3818_conv:7637_2_246
I'm sorry to hear that. I'm going on just over two years. Never thought it would happen to us.	hit:3818_conv:7637_3_430
Neither did we. He seemed so healthy, and then within weeks he was so sick he couldn't even talk. I miss him every day,	hit:3818_conv:7637_4_246
They will live on in our love and memories. I hope the heaviness lessens one day at a time <3	hit:3818_conv:7637_5_430
The other day I checked my email and a former client I did some freelance work had emailed me a gift card out of the blue! I was happy.	hit:3819_conv:7638_1_473
surprise gifts are always fun.	hit:3819_conv:7638_2_463
Very! I decided since it was surprise money I would waste it on something fun.	hit:3819_conv:7638_3_473
that sounds like a well deserved plan.	hit:3819_conv:7638_4_463
I remember the first I went to a theme park.  I had been planning on the way there not to go on any roller coasters, but just being there changed my mind quickly.	hit:3820_conv:7641_1_403
Oh man, I can relate, that feeling of anxiety before you get there really turns around when you get caught up in the moment	hit:3820_conv:7641_2_476
Exactly.  I just saw how much fun it looked and I thought to myself I should just live a little.  It's not often you get to have experiences like that.	hit:3820_conv:7641_3_403
Life is full of experiences like that, they seem scary from the outside, but once you relax you get swept away	hit:3820_conv:7641_4_476
i lost $100 cash somewhere. I have looked everywhere and i can't find it	hit:3822_conv:7645_1_327
that sounds prettty bad!	hit:3822_conv:7645_2_477
yes, i have retraced my steps and i can't find it.  hopefully i will find it when i need it the most.	hit:3822_conv:7645_3_327
I cannot imagine if something like that happens to me. I would be trying very hard to find it.	hit:3822_conv:7645_4_477
i have looked everywhere. it's so frustrating.	hit:3822_conv:7645_5_327
Sometimes by remembering all the places that you have been in the past two days can help. I will try that!	hit:3822_conv:7645_6_477
I really hate when people let their kids run wild in public. I do believe kids should be kids but there is a time and place for it.	hit:3823_conv:7646_1_347
I agree completely it is an embarrassment to the parents you would think. 	hit:3823_conv:7646_2_284
The worst is when they're screaming at them rather than just speaking to them calmly. 	hit:3823_conv:7646_3_347
The frustration they go through well at least we don't have to take the kids or parents home.	hit:3823_conv:7646_4_284
I wanted to go and get the tissue that was on sale was so bummed it was sold out.	hit:3823_conv:7647_1_284
What store were you at? 	hit:3823_conv:7647_2_347
I was going to Walgreen's and they was out and the sale began today. 	hit:3823_conv:7647_3_284
Could you get a rain check? That is a bummer? 	hit:3823_conv:7647_4_347
It get's worse no rain check but they insist on giving me customer service number to still receive points towards my card.	hit:3823_conv:7647_5_284
it was my birthday and felt like no one really cared 	hit:3826_conv:7652_1_417
Aw man, I'm sorry to hear that. Is there anything I can do to make you feel better? 	hit:3826_conv:7652_2_470
thanks! my coworker went out on lunch break and bought my favorite ice cream cake!	hit:3826_conv:7652_3_417
Ice cream cake is my favorite! I'm glad you're feeling better haha. You have a really nice co-worker.	hit:3826_conv:7652_4_470
yes she is honestly the greatest 	hit:3826_conv:7652_5_417
That's really awesome! She sounds like a great person to work with.	hit:3826_conv:7652_6_470
I completely ate the last cupcake even though I know my husband will want one when he gets home. Should I go get some more?	hit:3828_conv:7657_1_430
Oh, I know how that goes. My husband loves sweets, but if it is just sitting there and no one is eating it It will get eaten right then. Getting another would depend on how much he likes sweets and needs them. lol	hit:3828_conv:7657_2_228
Right! It's almost like, you knew this was going to happen. I feel terrible but it was so good lol. I'll get him some more tomorrow!	hit:3828_conv:7657_3_430
That's probably what I would do also. It won't kill him to wait another day.	hit:3828_conv:7657_4_228
I was at the store the other day and the lady ahead of me had no idea how to use self checkout, I wish she would have used the regular line instead of holding everyone up.	hit:3831_conv:7662_1_473
Oh I hate when that happens. we go to self checkout to avoid things like slow lines.	hit:3831_conv:7662_2_475
Exactly! I wasn't in a hurry or anything but it felt so inconsiderate.	hit:3831_conv:7662_3_473
Hopefully the person learned what they had to do so they don't hold the line up in the future.	hit:3831_conv:7662_4_475
We can only hope.	hit:3831_conv:7662_5_473
When I was in high school there was a girl I had liked for a long time that ended up dating my best friend.	hit:3831_conv:7663_1_475
Oh man, that must have hurt. Did she know you had feelings for her?	hit:3831_conv:7663_2_473
"Yes. But at the time she was unavailable. Then when she wasn't spoken for my ""friend"" asked her out."	hit:3831_conv:7663_3_475
Sounds like your friend broke bro code, that was kind of scummy.	hit:3831_conv:7663_4_473
I had mentioned to my friend one day that my computer was pretty much on its way out.  Some time later I found that he had sent me the money to buy a new one.	hit:3832_conv:7664_1_403
Wow! What a nice friend. I wish my friends did that	hit:3832_conv:7664_2_234
Yea I was really thankful and appreciative for it.  He's like a brother to me.	hit:3832_conv:7664_3_403
That's great. It's nice to have people so close to you. It really helps in bad times	hit:3832_conv:7664_4_234
It really does.  I think when it comes to friends quality is better than quantity.  I like to have friends that feel like family.	hit:3832_conv:7664_5_403
I cried so hard seeing my baby girl walk across the stage at her VPK graduation.	hit:3834_conv:7669_1_284
That must of been a proud moment for you as a father.  She's all grown up and out in the real world now	hit:3834_conv:7669_2_448
Yes this is a new milestone and now she get's to see what real school is all about with all age groups.	hit:3834_conv:7669_3_284
That's awesome, she'll have a great time and learn a lot i'm sure!	hit:3834_conv:7669_4_448
I entered a raffle at a local fair and actually won $1000.	hit:3837_conv:7675_1_475
Wow! What are you gonna do with the winnings?	hit:3837_conv:7675_2_1
Oh they are long gone,lol. Bills to pay and all.	hit:3837_conv:7675_3_475
Bills do take up a lot, don't they.	hit:3837_conv:7675_4_1
They sure do. The raffle did allow me to get ahead of things for a while though.	hit:3837_conv:7675_5_475
One time I moved into a new apartment, it was this big loft in a converted warehouse. I had this automatic soap dispenser that went nuts on me and made this really scary sound, I thought the place was haunted!	hit:3842_conv:7684_1_473
Oh my gosh! thats funny.  was that the only thing that made you think it was haunted?	hit:3842_conv:7684_2_445
Haha yeah it was pretty funny once I realized what the spooky sound coming from the kitchen was.	hit:3842_conv:7684_3_473
How did you discover exactly what it was?	hit:3842_conv:7684_4_445
I turned off the TV and my phone and tried to trace the sound to its source. I feel ridiculous about it now in hindsight!	hit:3842_conv:7684_5_473
I have a fear for roller coaster but I let my siblings talk me into getting on one last night.	hit:3847_conv:7694_1_284
Roller coasters are scary for me. How was it for you?	hit:3847_conv:7694_2_1
Fun but scary I couldn't wait for it to end lol had my eyes closed most of the ride. 	hit:3847_conv:7694_3_284
I'm the same way haha. But how was it fun if you have your eyes closed the whole time?!	hit:3847_conv:7694_4_1
My hands was up and feeling the wind in my face and facing my fears but I kept them closed because I just couldn't look because of the height lol. 	hit:3847_conv:7694_5_284
I had to put my cat down a few years ago, she was old and in kidney failure.	hit:3848_conv:7697_1_473
I am so sorry to hear that. I'm sure she was very happy while she was alive with you guys.	hit:3848_conv:7697_2_1
She had a good life. She was actually my mom's cat, she came to live with me when my mom died.	hit:3848_conv:7697_3_473
You went through a lot of losses.	hit:3848_conv:7697_4_1
Someone buggy was in the way at Publix and I tripped and fell in the aisle. 	hit:3850_conv:7701_1_284
That sounds painful, I hope you were okay after your fall. 	hit:3850_conv:7701_2_138
I was ok just the look on m face let you know I was ashamed lol I turned red instantly. 	hit:3850_conv:7701_3_284
Yeah i bet that was really embarrassing, but I'm glad you're okay. 	hit:3850_conv:7701_4_138
I applied for a job one time where I was one of 4 people being considered for it and had to wait a week to find out if I got it.	hit:3855_conv:7710_1_475
Oh boy!  That's always a nail biter waiting to hear back and it seems like they love to take the full amount of time before they let you know. Did you get it?!!	hit:3855_conv:7710_2_438
I did get it! If I was a praying kind of guy I would have done so every day. I was o nervous.	hit:3855_conv:7710_3_475
Amazing! Congratulation! Prayer is always a good thing to do! That is so incredible.  Are you enjoying the job?	hit:3855_conv:7710_4_438
I remember being younger and waiting on Christmas Day to unwrap presents.  There were a lot of things I wanted that year.	hit:3856_conv:7713_1_403
I remember those times. Did you get what you wanted?	hit:3856_conv:7713_2_1
Well I was really looking forward to the Super Nintendo.  It had just come out that year and everyone my age wanted one.	hit:3856_conv:7713_3_403
The super nintendo is a classic. What is your favorite game?	hit:3856_conv:7713_4_1
Yea, they tried to trick me and wrap a box of clothes the same size to make me think I didn't get it.  My favorite game has to be Earthbound.	hit:3856_conv:7713_5_403
I fell off my bike the other day in front of a bunch of people. It was kind of humiliating.	hit:3861_conv:7722_1_473
Oh no! I'm so sorry!  I would feel the same way but you just have to think...who cares what others think!  If they can't have compassion for an accident then something is wrong with them.  Did you get hurt?	hit:3861_conv:7722_2_438
You're right, the other people probably hardly noticed. And no, thankfully I was OK! Unless you count the bruise on my ego.	hit:3861_conv:7722_3_473
I bet they didn't.  I like to look at experiences as part of our journey and teaches us to have compassion for others in similar situations.  So glad you're alright! Hope you own a helmet!	hit:3861_conv:7722_4_438
That's solid advice, thank you. And yes, I own a helmet, but admittedly don't wear it as often as I should. I will now!	hit:3861_conv:7722_5_473
This one year right after I moved to the east coast we had this scary hurricane warning. I went ahead and stocked up on all the basics; batteries, canned goods, beer. I was set!	hit:3868_conv:7737_1_473
How'd the hurricane go?	hit:3868_conv:7737_2_1
Wouldn't you know it totally missed my city. I was a little let down to be honest, though glad we were safe.	hit:3868_conv:7737_3_473
Thank goodness. Hurricanes are no joke.	hit:3868_conv:7737_4_1
I was going on a trip and couldn't take my dog so I had to board him and I was so worried about it.	hit:3874_conv:7748_1_475
Was he okay?	hit:3874_conv:7748_2_27
He was fine. I just didn't know how he was going to handle it, he is a very nervous dog.	hit:3874_conv:7748_3_475
Well maybe if you do it a little more then he will be fine with it. I would be afraid just because he is afraid.	hit:3874_conv:7748_4_27
That's true. He was a rescue and sometimes I wonder if he was treated in a bad way and thats why he is like that.	hit:3874_conv:7748_5_475
Maybe so. It's good he has a good home now.	hit:3874_conv:7748_6_27
I like to think he does. I just hope he is as happy as he makes me.	hit:3874_conv:7748_7_475
I bet he is. Don't worry	hit:3874_conv:7748_8_27
I usually food prep for the week it is so much easier.	hit:3881_conv:7762_1_284
That is a great idea	hit:3881_conv:7762_2_126
Yes it works out great saves me money and keeps my scheduled arranged and on track. 	hit:3881_conv:7762_3_284
Saving money is important	hit:3881_conv:7762_4_126
My daughter graduated high school as a straight A student last year	hit:3885_conv:7771_1_475
That's amazing! You must be so proud.	hit:3885_conv:7771_2_1
Oh I am. It's nice to know that I raised a child with a good head on her shoulders.	hit:3885_conv:7771_3_475
She's also a hard worker.	hit:3885_conv:7771_4_1
I like to think so, although it seemed to alwasy be easy for her. 	hit:3885_conv:7771_5_475
Yesterday my Lyft driver offered to carry my groceries up to my apartment. I thought that was super nice, there were A LOT of bags.	hit:3889_conv:7778_1_473
That was very sweet they don't have to actually do that.	hit:3889_conv:7778_2_284
It was sweet. And I told him not to worry about it, I didn't want to hold him up. 	hit:3889_conv:7778_3_473
Good to know there is still kind people in the world.	hit:3889_conv:7778_4_284
I got some pink roses at work last week I was so happy.	hit:3889_conv:7779_1_284
That's awesome! Who were they from?	hit:3889_conv:7779_2_473
My husband but I didn't expect it I was so surprised they was a just because gift.	hit:3889_conv:7779_3_284
That was really sweet of him, maybe he just wanted you to know you're loved.	hit:3889_conv:7779_4_473
I am about to leave on a 17 hour car trip with my husband, our four kids, and 2 dogs. I think I have everything ready to go though	hit:3893_conv:7786_1_61
You can never be too prepared! I am sure you have got everything.	hit:3893_conv:7786_2_243
I hope so. I even portioned out each meal for our dogs in little plastic bags to make sure we have enough. 	hit:3893_conv:7786_3_61
That was very smart thinking on your part. Have fun on your trip!	hit:3893_conv:7786_4_243
I sent an email I shouldn't have sent. I'd been drinking and totally should have saved it rather than sending it when I did.	hit:3899_conv:7799_1_473
We all do things we regret when drinking	hit:3899_conv:7799_2_126
True. The funny thing was I obsessed over it for days, worrying I made a mistake. And absolutely nothing happened! I worried for nothing.	hit:3899_conv:7799_3_473
Thats usually how it goes	hit:3899_conv:7799_4_126
A few years ago I decided to move cross-country. It was kind of terrifying taking a huge leap like that with no job and hardly knowing anyone here.	hit:3924_conv:7849_1_473
You definitely took a leap of faith there. How'd it go?	hit:3924_conv:7849_2_1
It definitely has had its ups and downs but overall I'm really glad I did it. I don't think I'll be doing it again any time soon that's for sure.	hit:3924_conv:7849_3_473
hahaha I definitely admire your courage to have done that.	hit:3924_conv:7849_4_1
I'm going back to school I am going to stick to my goal and don't stop until I get my degree.	hit:3925_conv:7851_1_284
I wish you luck	hit:3925_conv:7851_2_126
Thanks I am super excited I know I will have a great outcome I have goals to meet.	hit:3925_conv:7851_3_284
I am sure you will meet them	hit:3925_conv:7851_4_126
I spent my birthday last year alone. I expected my boyfriend to make plans but nope.	hit:3930_conv:7860_1_473
That's disappointing. What happened? Did he just not do anything?	hit:3930_conv:7860_2_1
Yeah, he acted like it was just a normal day, it was so weird. Maybe I'm getting too old to make a big deal out of birthdays anyway.	hit:3930_conv:7860_3_473
I would have been disappointed, too. 	hit:3930_conv:7860_4_1
I get so annoyed when it rains I had plans for a family cookout but it started thundering and lightening such a bummer. 	hit:3932_conv:7865_1_284
Oh no that is a total bummer. It's especially common in the summer months.	hit:3932_conv:7865_2_332
Yes it's the worse especially in Florida it's sunny one day and pouring down raining the next. 	hit:3932_conv:7865_3_284
Oh right, I spent some time in Florida when I was younger and I remember it being so unpredictable. Just gotta keep an umbrella all the time lol.	hit:3932_conv:7865_4_332
I went to a book release party yesterday.	hit:3934_conv:7869_1_462
Cool. Was it interesting?	hit:3934_conv:7869_2_27
Yes. It was a good friend of mine. She got a novel published! She also has four small kids. I'm not sure how she does it all.	hit:3934_conv:7869_3_462
Good for her! Moms get a lot done lol	hit:3934_conv:7869_4_27
My best friend is moving across the country next week. 	hit:3938_conv:7876_1_462
ARe you happy or sad?	hit:3938_conv:7876_2_27
Sad. I will miss her terribly 	hit:3938_conv:7876_3_462
I bet. I she moving school or a job?	hit:3938_conv:7876_4_27
My job recognized me for my hard work I was thankful and surprised I just love my job.	hit:3941_conv:7882_1_284
Oh cool that's great! What were you doing that they recognised?	hit:3941_conv:7882_2_482
For over exceeding and helping all staff when in need, I am always just helpful but was happy to get noticed for my hard work.	hit:3941_conv:7882_3_284
Awesome. What is your job?	hit:3941_conv:7882_4_482
I work for the state we help clients with disabilities find employment it is case management work.	hit:3941_conv:7882_5_284
I got a random email this morning with a $120 gift voucher	hit:3941_conv:7883_1_482
Wow was it a scam or was it legit?	hit:3941_conv:7883_2_284
I was really sure it was a scam but it turned out it was a prize for a survey I had submitted a few weeks ago!	hit:3941_conv:7883_3_482
That is so good congratulations you are lucky what are you going to use it for?	hit:3941_conv:7883_4_284
Thanks! No idea actually, it's for a department store here in Australia so will have to look around	hit:3941_conv:7883_5_482
"There was an ""incident"" at the gym today."	hit:3944_conv:7889_1_462
Oh no, what happened?	hit:3944_conv:7889_2_332
I finished a fabulous workout, then promptly fell UP the stairs on my way to the locker room. In front of everyone. I was mortified.	hit:3944_conv:7889_3_462
Oh no! But that happens (it has happened to me several times). At least you had the great workout!	hit:3944_conv:7889_4_332
After four long, broke months of looking, I finally got offered a job today!	hit:3949_conv:7899_1_462
That's great. Are you excited?	hit:3949_conv:7899_2_27
Yes, and incredibly happy. I was getting really worried about the bills. 	hit:3949_conv:7899_3_462
Is it your dream job? Then you should really be happy.	hit:3949_conv:7899_4_27
I had an email telling me I had a $120 gift voucher this morning	hit:3952_conv:7905_1_482
Was it real?	hit:3952_conv:7905_2_27
Haha that was my first thought too. It actually was!	hit:3952_conv:7905_3_482
That's awesome. What are you going to buy?	hit:3952_conv:7905_4_27
Thanks! No idea actually, it's for a department store here in Australia	hit:3952_conv:7905_5_482
Australia. I hope to go there some day	hit:3952_conv:7905_6_27
You definitely should! It's a really cool place, but so hard to see everything because it's so big	hit:3952_conv:7905_7_482
I bet, I will get there one day	hit:3952_conv:7905_8_27
I knocked over a clothing display on the sidewalk outside of a boutique the other day when I was riding my bike. I should have gone back to pick it up but kept going.	hit:3956_conv:7912_1_473
I've done the same thing before. I'm sure you weren't a bother	hit:3956_conv:7912_2_478
I hope not. Now that you mention it I'm sure it happens all the time.	hit:3956_conv:7912_3_473
Yeah and they really should be better about how they place their racks	hit:3956_conv:7912_4_478
I was waiting for a while for a video game to come out.  When it finally did it wasn't as great as I thought it was going to be.	hit:3957_conv:7915_1_403
That has happend to me too.	hit:3957_conv:7915_2_27
I got my hopes up too much. I should wait for reviews to come out before I rush out and buy next time.	hit:3957_conv:7915_3_403
You can always sell them if you buy discs. Cant do anything with a download though	hit:3957_conv:7915_4_27
That's very true.  Which is why I prefer physical discs most of the time.	hit:3957_conv:7915_5_403
We live and we learn lol	hit:3957_conv:7915_6_27
Exactly.  Next time I'm waiting for prices to drop, months after launch.	hit:3957_conv:7915_7_403
The other day I was listening to Spotify and put U2's Achtung Baby on. It reminds me of pre middle school days.	hit:3960_conv:7920_1_473
I used to love that band	hit:3960_conv:7920_2_126
Yeah they were great back in the day. I can't comment on their new stuff, I haven't listened to any of it in years.	hit:3960_conv:7920_3_473
I have not either	hit:3960_conv:7920_4_126
So the cable repair guy was supposed to show up between 8:30 and 12:30 on Friday. Guess when he showed up....	hit:3962_conv:7924_1_462
Probably at 4 or 5! lol	hit:3962_conv:7924_2_296
You got it. 5:00. WHY does this still happen? I wasted the whole day waiting. 	hit:3962_conv:7924_3_462
No idea! I haven't had cable in so long! I would HATE that and they always over charge! Don't they have a rule that theres no service fee if they are late?	hit:3962_conv:7924_4_296
I got a random email telling me I had won a gift card	hit:3965_conv:7931_1_482
Was it real because I get those every day lol	hit:3965_conv:7931_2_27
Haha yeah it actually turned out to be real! It was for $120	hit:3965_conv:7931_3_482
I could do so much with $120. Im jealous lol	hit:3965_conv:7931_4_27
We had a near-disaster at our house today.	hit:3968_conv:7936_1_462
oh no! what happened?	hit:3968_conv:7936_2_280
My older son called from the bathroom that we were out of toilet paper. It seemed...um...urgent....Fortunately, we had an emergency stash in the laundry room.	hit:3968_conv:7936_3_462
ah, crisis averted! that could have been a lot worse	hit:3968_conv:7936_4_280
We went to our favorite Italian restaurant for dinner tonight.	hit:3977_conv:7954_1_462
Was it good? I hate when your favorite place disappoints.	hit:3977_conv:7954_2_27
"It was good! It always is. I had my ""usual"" pasta and just enough wine to feel relaxed, but not loopy. It was a good way to end a Sunday."	hit:3977_conv:7954_3_462
That's great. Sundays are supposed to be breezy	hit:3977_conv:7954_4_27
I didn't have a pen while returning a rental car to an unattended location	hit:3978_conv:7957_1_482
Hm, that sounds interesting. I'm not really familiar with this kind of situation, since I've never had to rent a car. What exactly happened, or what did that mean?	hit:3978_conv:7957_2_273
Yeah I was travelling in the US and they just had a drop box where you put the keys and a form in. Luckily I asked a stranger who was passing by and they gave me a really nice pen to keep	hit:3978_conv:7957_3_482
Oh, so it was no big deal? At least you cared enough to stop someone and ask them about it. No harm, no foul.	hit:3978_conv:7957_4_273
I recently got an email from my old company hinting that they wanted me back. It was kind of exciting, I really wanted it to work out.	hit:3980_conv:7961_1_473
I bet that was a nice feeling	hit:3980_conv:7961_2_126
It definitely was. The money is great and I get to set my own hours!	hit:3980_conv:7961_3_473
That sounds perfect	hit:3980_conv:7961_4_126
I have a dentist appointment first thing tomorrow morning. 	hit:3983_conv:7966_1_462
The dentist makes me a bit nervous	hit:3983_conv:7966_2_397
It makes me VERY nervous. I hate it. I'll probably barely sleep tonight because of it. 	hit:3983_conv:7966_3_462
Well at least think about the fact that it's a good thing to go to the dentist!	hit:3983_conv:7966_4_397
I got back from vacation last week and found a huge dent in my car. 	hit:3990_conv:7981_1_462
That is awful, did the person who hit it leave a note or a call back number? 	hit:3990_conv:7981_2_386
No. They just hit it and left the airport parking lot. I'm pretty incensed. 	hit:3990_conv:7981_3_462
You should ask the airport people if they have any security footage of the parking lot, maybe they can track down the car.	hit:3990_conv:7981_4_386
I went to the fanciest dinner party the other night. It was  eight amazing courses of food!	hit:4001_conv:8003_1_462
What kind of food was there?	hit:4001_conv:8003_2_7
Really intricate things - souffles and such. I was very impressed.	hit:4001_conv:8003_3_462
It is nice that you enjoyed it.	hit:4001_conv:8003_4_7
I saw a mouse run across my kitchen last night. I woke everyone up with my screaming.	hit:4009_conv:8018_1_462
Oh man.  That would of startled me too.  What did you do after?	hit:4009_conv:8018_2_282
Stood on the couch and screamed some more! I do not do rodents. I'm having my son handle it. I think he's putting out traps tonight.	hit:4009_conv:8018_3_462
Well I can understand your nervousness.  I probably would be on guard as well	hit:4009_conv:8018_4_282
My kitty that I had since she was a kitten passed away. She was only four years old.	hit:4026_conv:8053_1_430
Oh that is tough.  It is hard when our pets pass away.	hit:4026_conv:8053_2_282
"It really is. She was the first pet that was really ""mine"". She brought a lot of happiness to my life!"	hit:4026_conv:8053_3_430
It is like losing a family member isn't it.  Well, just think of all the good times and be thankful.	hit:4026_conv:8053_4_282
I had a test the other day and I'm pretty sure I aced it. I studied for like a week!	hit:4036_conv:8072_1_430
That's great! I never really studied much so I could have done better on my tests	hit:4036_conv:8072_2_234
Same here. I never had to study for high school but when I hit college, it was a wakeup call.	hit:4036_conv:8072_3_430
Oh yes. But, I found that getting involved in clubs along with a major I liked actually allowed me to spend less time studying and more time learning for fun. It's a subtle, but important diffeence	hit:4036_conv:8072_4_234
So all my friends went on vacation last week :(	hit:4042_conv:8085_1_430
Judging by the :(, I'm assuming you didn't get to join them?	hit:4042_conv:8085_2_489
Yeah, we were supposed to go but I couldn't get off work. I got to see all the pictures on Facebook though, ha! So envious.	hit:4042_conv:8085_3_430
I would be envious too.  Perhaps next time you can go somewhere and return the feeling :D	hit:4042_conv:8085_4_489
Sounds like a plan :)	hit:4042_conv:8085_5_430
I hope where ever you go, you visit someplace amazing!	hit:4042_conv:8085_6_489
Man I am stuffed.  I found a new pizza joint in town.	hit:4048_conv:8097_1_132
That is nice. Do you like a lot pizza?	hit:4048_conv:8097_2_7
Yeah I definitely like a lot of pizza.  This place had a all you can eat buffet.  I ate my fill of pizza!	hit:4048_conv:8097_3_132
You are lucky.	hit:4048_conv:8097_4_7
I made sure it was the only thing I ate all day.  I was pretty content.	hit:4048_conv:8097_5_132
Man I couldn't get any sleep last night.	hit:4053_conv:8106_1_132
Were you worried about something? What was keeping you up?	hit:4053_conv:8106_2_386
There was something scratching on my window.  I was pretty nervous.	hit:4053_conv:8106_3_132
Hopefully you had a lock on them, you can never be too safe.	hit:4053_conv:8106_4_386
Well that's the thing.  when I looked out in the morning I didn't see anything.	hit:4053_conv:8106_5_132
One year for our anniversary, an iPad showed up at my office. My boyfriend had ordered it and timed it so arrived on our exact anniversary. I didn't expect it at all!	hit:4054_conv:8108_1_473
Dang really! Sounds like you have a boyfriend that likes to shower you with presents.	hit:4054_conv:8108_2_182
"He's generous yeah but I wouldn't call it ""showering."" He's just good about knowing what I need!"	hit:4054_conv:8108_3_473
That means that he is always listening and paying attention to you!	hit:4054_conv:8108_4_182
I used to enjoy cold showers in the morining.	hit:4059_conv:8119_1_326
I have never tried a cold shower? What is it like?	hit:4059_conv:8119_2_496
It's very cold and refreshing, wakes you up instantly.	hit:4059_conv:8119_3_326
I bet it does wake you up right away. I guess I should try that sometime if I oversleep. lol !	hit:4059_conv:8119_4_496
My neighbor refuses to clean up after her dog and it's infuriating.	hit:4061_conv:8123_1_473
wow that is very rude of her	hit:4061_conv:8123_2_497
It really is. I'm not sure what to do though besides reporting her to the HOA. Any suggestion?	hit:4061_conv:8123_3_473
No I have never dealt with a rude person like that that lives near me	hit:4061_conv:8123_4_497
Lucky you! For some reason I seem to be attracted to apartments filled with rude people.	hit:4061_conv:8123_5_473
What else do we need, just a sunny bench and some chips.	hit:4063_conv:8126_1_326
I totally agree. That actually sounds really good rihgt now.	hit:4063_conv:8126_2_487
So lets go, I'll meet you outside in an hour. 	hit:4063_conv:8126_3_326
Sounds fun. Ill be ready. Hope were going to the beach thats closest to us!	hit:4063_conv:8126_4_487
I am looking forward for tomorrow. 	hit:4065_conv:8131_1_326
 I will be expecting to see you there.	hit:4065_conv:8131_2_499
Yes, tomorrow as well as today are such a nice places. 	hit:4065_conv:8131_3_326
Having positive attitude always succeed. Keep it up.	hit:4065_conv:8131_4_499
I was walking around town yesterday and saw a girl with crazy hairstyle.	hit:4068_conv:8136_1_326
Interesting.  What was the first thought that popped into your head when you witnessed this?	hit:4068_conv:8136_2_500
It was...Dandelion. 	hit:4068_conv:8136_3_326
Is that a reference to the color of the hair, the shape or something else?	hit:4068_conv:8136_4_500
Man I felt good when I applied for my job!	hit:4072_conv:8144_1_132
How did it go? That's an anxiety-inducing but hopeful situation!	hit:4072_conv:8144_2_490
No I was very assured in my interview.  I got the job, probably because of my attitude.	hit:4072_conv:8144_3_132
Congratulations! Enjoy the new gig! Good things happen to good people.	hit:4072_conv:8144_4_490
I could definitely feel it going to other way if I was defeatist in my interview.	hit:4072_conv:8144_5_132
Being defeatist is never a good move. Honestly, once you've got your foot in the door I think it's all about personality. 	hit:4072_conv:8144_6_490
It can be, but personality can't make up for incomptence either.	hit:4072_conv:8144_7_132
I would argue most good employers can diagnose incompetence from the first or second conversation. If they can't, maybe they aren't good employers.	hit:4072_conv:8144_8_490
I flipped through my high school yearbooks the other day for the first time in a long time. I can't believe how much time has passed.	hit:4074_conv:8149_1_473
Time does fly really fast. I just turned 30 and it feels like I was just a teenager yesterday!	hit:4074_conv:8149_2_286
Enjoy it, your 30s go by really fast. I'm clinging desperately to the last few years of mine myself.	hit:4074_conv:8149_3_473
I'm sure it will. At least it gets us to enjoy life more and focus on the moment.	hit:4074_conv:8149_4_286
It's very strange when you meet somebody you know, in the middle of a megalopolis. 	hit:4087_conv:8174_1_326
Yeah, it's like a small world.	hit:4087_conv:8174_2_322
Exactly, how does it even work?	hit:4087_conv:8174_3_326
I think it is merely a coincidence.	hit:4087_conv:8174_4_322
Small thing in life used to make me shed tears.	hit:4095_conv:8191_1_326
Indeed they can. Is there any specific moment that you would like to talk about?	hit:4095_conv:8191_2_155
Yes, things like great classical music for example. 	hit:4095_conv:8191_3_326
Oh, I see. I thought that some other bad things happening in your personal life are making you cry	hit:4095_conv:8191_4_155
We have to stay positive through all the things that happen in the world. 	hit:4096_conv:8193_1_326
I completely agree. We must have positive thoughts at all times. 	hit:4096_conv:8193_2_502
Yes, that's a good start.	hit:4096_conv:8193_3_326
Our thoughts are were everything starts. Mindset is so important. 	hit:4096_conv:8193_4_502
Someone my husband used to work with got a promotion and a really big raise.	hit:4100_conv:8200_1_61
That's awesome!  What do they do?	hit:4100_conv:8200_2_310
They work in the oil field. My husband left the company they both worked for and I can't help but think if he still worked their he would have gotten a raise too.	hit:4100_conv:8200_3_61
That would be nice, but it's never good to dwell on things like that instead of looking toward the future.	hit:4100_conv:8200_4_310
Last week driving to work, I got pulled over for speeding.	hit:4105_conv:8211_1_340
That sucks. How fast were you driving?	hit:4105_conv:8211_2_244
Only a couple miles over. It's always a terrible thing to see those lights in your mirror.	hit:4105_conv:8211_3_340
I hate getting pulled over too. Especailly for something silly like being a couple of miles an hour over the speed limit	hit:4105_conv:8211_4_244
I haven't drank beer in almost a year, but yesterday I relapsed. I feel like such a loser.	hit:4108_conv:8217_1_250
Oh man, I'm so sorry to hear that. You're not a loser though! Just take one day at a time. If you relapsed yesterday just move on and do your best not to drink today and tomorrow	hit:4108_conv:8217_2_52
I just can't believe I gave in to the pressure. Oh well, yeah your right. I'll start by taking baby steps.	hit:4108_conv:8217_3_250
Don't be so hard on yourself. We are all humans, we make mistakes. 	hit:4108_conv:8217_4_52
My neighbor is remodeling his house, which I hate, because they start at 5:30 in the morning.	hit:4111_conv:8223_1_340
That is probably so annoying	hit:4111_conv:8223_2_27
I have a 3 year old, so he wakes up at 5:30 because of all the hammering going on.	hit:4111_conv:8223_3_340
That really sucks. How long will it be going on?	hit:4111_conv:8223_4_27
My wife told me she's pregnant the other day. I was baffled by the news because the doctor told us she only had a ten percent chance of having a baby.	hit:4120_conv:8241_1_250
Wow.  That's either really lucky or unlucky, depending on what you want.  Are you wanting kids?	hit:4120_conv:8241_2_310
Yeah, it just came at an unexpected time. I really want a little boy.	hit:4120_conv:8241_3_250
Well, then congratulations!  I wish you the best of luck, and enjoy this time! :)	hit:4120_conv:8241_4_310
I went to see a movie last night. I wasn't really able to enjoy it though.	hit:4123_conv:8246_1_503
Why not?	hit:4123_conv:8246_2_296
There was this couple sitting two rows in front of me.... they just wouldn't shut up.	hit:4123_conv:8246_3_503
Oh man! That is why I watch movies at home. It's just more comfortable.	hit:4123_conv:8246_4_296
I saw a psychiatrist for the first time yesterday. It was alright, but I have to admit I was a bit skeptical at first.	hit:4128_conv:8257_1_250
I have considered it myself but feel the same as you. Will you go back again? 	hit:4128_conv:8257_2_11
I might. It just makes me a little uneasy having to share personal information with a total stranger.	hit:4128_conv:8257_3_250
right, i feel you but maybe it will be good to get it all out!! 	hit:4128_conv:8257_4_11
My mom called me about a year ago and told me she had cancer.	hit:4165_conv:8331_1_61
Is she doing okay now?	hit:4165_conv:8331_2_10
Yes, she had a really difficult 6 months and then things started improving. 	hit:4165_conv:8331_3_61
great, I am very glad to hear she is getting better!	hit:4165_conv:8331_4_10
I was very pleased to get this job	hit:4173_conv:8346_1_508
What is the job?	hit:4173_conv:8346_2_10
I got the job has an software Analysis and that was aim	hit:4173_conv:8346_3_508
Well congrats then, I am sure that is not easy	hit:4173_conv:8346_4_10
A little bit. But when we doing it in a rightway from our heart really it will be easy 	hit:4173_conv:8346_5_508
I was so angry, I threw a bottle of water!	hit:4180_conv:8361_1_509
What caused that to happen?	hit:4180_conv:8361_2_506
A server went down and I didn't get paid for my work :(	hit:4180_conv:8361_3_509
Oh gosh, hopefully it doesnt happen next time	hit:4180_conv:8361_4_506
Yeah I hope not, I can't afford work stoppages!	hit:4180_conv:8361_5_509
i felt nostalgic looking through old photos today	hit:4181_conv:8362_1_44
What were the photos of?	hit:4181_conv:8362_2_506
just old family photos	hit:4181_conv:8362_3_44
It is good to have those and look at once in awhile	hit:4181_conv:8362_4_506
A couple months ago, my wife and I got divorced.	hit:4188_conv:8377_1_340
I am sorry to hear that, what happened?	hit:4188_conv:8377_2_10
We just grew apart I guess. House seems so empty with her and the kids gone.	hit:4188_conv:8377_3_340
Did you try therapy at all or counseling?	hit:4188_conv:8377_4_10
We can't afford to live in our home anymore	hit:4189_conv:8379_1_509
Why is that?	hit:4189_conv:8379_2_10
We're poor, and bills are adding up	hit:4189_conv:8379_3_509
I am sorry to hear that, I hope things improve for you a ton!	hit:4189_conv:8379_4_10
Thank you! I do as well	hit:4189_conv:8379_5_509
Boy, it's been a lot of owrk	hit:4190_conv:8380_1_509
Sometimes we believe is the things that happen to us ... they are many	hit:4190_conv:8380_2_264
What sort of things?	hit:4190_conv:8380_3_509
I interpret the difficulties	hit:4190_conv:8380_4_264
What sort of difficulties/	hit:4190_conv:8380_5_509
the lack of humor	hit:4190_conv:8380_6_264
Ah, it's no joke is it	hit:4190_conv:8380_7_509
Ok	hit:4190_conv:8380_8_264
Last year, my father passed away.	hit:4192_conv:8385_1_340
Oh goodness, I am so sorry to hear that. Was it sudden?	hit:4192_conv:8385_2_510
Yeah, he developed a stage 4 glioma in his brain that could not be removed.	hit:4192_conv:8385_3_340
That is awful and very sorry you had to go through that. I work at a cancer hospital so I can't imagine going through that with a loved one.	hit:4192_conv:8385_4_510
i feel nostalgic going through old boxes in my basement	hit:4193_conv:8387_1_44
What kind of stuff is in there?	hit:4193_conv:8387_2_10
just old sports uniforms and toys and stuff like that	hit:4193_conv:8387_3_44
Oh okay, I love going through my old stuff too, it is really fun	hit:4193_conv:8387_4_10
I have plans so go to the beach with my wife for a week next month	hit:4197_conv:8394_1_475
That sounds so fun!	hit:4197_conv:8394_2_99
I cant wait! we have been looking forward to going back since our honeymoon.	hit:4197_conv:8394_3_475
I hope you both have tons of fun!	hit:4197_conv:8394_4_99
Thank you. We plan on it!	hit:4197_conv:8394_5_475
I'm so glad my health is good	hit:4200_conv:8401_1_509
that's great! I'm glad to hear that. we often take our health for granted.	hit:4200_conv:8401_2_50
We do, and don't do enough to take care of it	hit:4200_conv:8401_3_509
i'm one of those people. Eat junk food even though i know it's not good for me	hit:4200_conv:8401_4_50
Ah, it'll catch up to you :(	hit:4200_conv:8401_5_509
Oh man. I can't believe I made that mistake at work today.	hit:4202_conv:8404_1_503
Uh OH what happened	hit:4202_conv:8404_2_255
I was giving a presentation on the project that I'm working on, and I overlooked something simple.... one of my coworkers called me out on it. How embarrassing.	hit:4202_conv:8404_3_503
Oh no, well mistakes do happen, it will be behind you in a few days	hit:4202_conv:8404_4_255
I certainly hope so. The sooner everyone forgets about this, the better.	hit:4202_conv:8404_5_503
Exactly good luck	hit:4202_conv:8404_6_255
Thank you, I'm just glad it was at the end of the presentation so I was able to get out of there shortly after.	hit:4202_conv:8404_7_503
I love to see old stuff from when I was a kid	hit:4202_conv:8405_1_255
Oh yeah? What kind of old stuff?	hit:4202_conv:8405_2_503
Old metal lunch boxes like Charlies Angels speed buggy ect	hit:4202_conv:8405_3_255
I always liked those old lunch boxes myself. Do you have a favorite?	hit:4202_conv:8405_4_503
Hong Kong Phooey lol	hit:4202_conv:8405_5_255
Nice! I loved that show when I was a kid. I never had the lunch box though.	hit:4202_conv:8405_6_503
It's time to move!	hit:4204_conv:8408_1_509
Oh, OK!  WHere are you moving to?	hit:4204_conv:8408_2_277
Another house, it's closer to school	hit:4204_conv:8408_3_509
That's good!  That will make your life much easier!  Congratulations!	hit:4204_conv:8408_4_277
So there's a girl that I've been talking to lately... I'm thinking about asking her out.	hit:4205_conv:8410_1_503
That's exciting. Do you have a plan for a date for when she says yes?	hit:4205_conv:8410_2_423
Yeah, I already have it all planned out. We get along really well, so I'm sure she's going to say yes.	hit:4205_conv:8410_3_503
What all is on the agenda for the date?	hit:4205_conv:8410_4_423
I'm going to take her to this restaurant she really likes, then go to a movie. I'm gonna show her a great time.	hit:4205_conv:8410_5_503
I've finally finished writing the book that I've been working on for the last few months.	hit:4206_conv:8412_1_503
Great. Are you going to get it published?	hit:4206_conv:8412_2_244
Definitely! I'm pretty happy with this one, can't wait to get it published.	hit:4206_conv:8412_3_503
What is the book about?	hit:4206_conv:8412_4_244
To say anything about it at all would be giving too much away!	hit:4206_conv:8412_5_503
Boo. What genre?	hit:4206_conv:8412_6_244
Oh man. I was cleaning out my fridge, and found something unpleasant.	hit:4207_conv:8414_1_503
OH NO that is the worst! Did you clean it up?	hit:4207_conv:8414_2_509
Well I threw it out. It was some unidentifiable stuff in a plastic container. It had been in there for months, I think.	hit:4207_conv:8414_3_503
You shoudl write the date on stuff to prevent that from happening again	hit:4207_conv:8414_4_509
You know, that's not a bad idea. Ugh, it was so disgusting.	hit:4207_conv:8414_5_503
My little one got injured	hit:4207_conv:8415_1_509
Oh no! What happened?	hit:4207_conv:8415_2_503
She fell off a kitchen stool	hit:4207_conv:8415_3_509
Ouch. I hope she's okay.	hit:4207_conv:8415_4_503
Whew. I had a lot of housework to get done, but it's finally finished.	hit:4208_conv:8416_1_503
thats good, its always a good feeling after	hit:4208_conv:8416_2_44
Yeah, I'm pretty happy. Now I can just sit back and relax.	hit:4208_conv:8416_3_503
thats the way to do it	hit:4208_conv:8416_4_44
I agree. Now I don't have anything to worry about for the rest of the day.	hit:4208_conv:8416_5_503
i was delighted with how well my nephew did at his little league game	hit:4208_conv:8417_1_44
Did his team win?	hit:4208_conv:8417_2_503
yes	hit:4208_conv:8417_3_44
That's great news! I bet you're so proud.	hit:4208_conv:8417_4_503
My clothing is making me crazy	hit:4209_conv:8419_1_509
Oh no!  Why are they driving you crazy?	hit:4209_conv:8419_2_277
They're totally itchy	hit:4209_conv:8419_3_509
That is no good!  I guess it is time for you to go shopping!	hit:4209_conv:8419_4_277
i admired the way my nieghbors helped each other out after a storm	hit:4210_conv:8420_1_44
Storms are the worst and destroy so much.	hit:4210_conv:8420_2_9
they are horrible, luckily this one wasnt deadly or too destructive	hit:4210_conv:8420_3_44
My family went through a big storm a few years ago.	hit:4210_conv:8420_4_9
I got a terrible phone call yesterday...	hit:4212_conv:8425_1_503
what happened on the phone call?	hit:4212_conv:8425_2_9
I found out that my brother died.	hit:4212_conv:8425_3_503
I am so sorry about that.	hit:4212_conv:8425_4_9
Thank you, I'm pretty devastated to be honest.	hit:4212_conv:8425_5_503
Ugh, my cat keeps attacking my foot.	hit:4213_conv:8426_1_503
Has it made any scratch marks?	hit:4213_conv:8426_2_423
Nah, he just keeps running up, grabbing and biting, then running away. It was cute and funny at first, now it's just irritating.	hit:4213_conv:8426_3_503
Have you tried disciplining him in anyway	hit:4213_conv:8426_4_423
Yeah, I've sprayed him with a water bottle a few times, it doesn't seem to work very well.	hit:4213_conv:8426_5_503
Sounds like it's time for a crate.	hit:4213_conv:8426_6_423
it is frustrating waiting on hold to speak to a human	hit:4214_conv:8428_1_44
Yea, I hate calling ATT or Verizon they take forever to get on the phone.	hit:4214_conv:8428_2_9
it is so annoying!	hit:4214_conv:8428_3_44
I think as we get smarter, it will get better.	hit:4214_conv:8428_4_9
I didn't expect to get anything for my birthday from my fiance since he's been broke, but he gave me a bouquet of flowers and took me out to eat still!	hit:4215_conv:8430_1_512
Wow!  Sounds like a keeper right there!  That must have been a nice surprise for you!	hit:4215_conv:8430_2_277
It really was! He had to scrimp and save, but it was worth it for both of us in the end :)	hit:4215_conv:8430_3_512
It is always nice when someone gets their priorities right!	hit:4215_conv:8430_4_277
So.... my dog got hit by a car last night.	hit:4216_conv:8433_1_503
Oh no!  That is horrible!  Is he OK?	hit:4216_conv:8433_2_277
No, unfortunately he didn't make it.	hit:4216_conv:8433_3_503
That is really sad!  I hope it was quick and painless.  I hate seeing anything suffer!	hit:4216_conv:8433_4_277
Yeah, I think it was, but... I'm pretty upset about it.	hit:4216_conv:8433_5_503
My son asked to borrow the keys to my car this morning.	hit:4217_conv:8434_1_503
Did you let him borrow it?	hit:4217_conv:8434_2_244
Yeah. I know most people would be worried about doing something like that, but... I trust him not to do anything stupid.	hit:4217_conv:8434_3_503
That's good to hear. I assume everything went ok?	hit:4217_conv:8434_4_244
Yeah, he brought it back in one piece. Which I'm obviously happy about.	hit:4217_conv:8434_5_503
Awesome. Alls well that ends well.	hit:4217_conv:8434_6_244
My daughter asked to borrow my car to go out tonight...	hit:4218_conv:8436_1_503
Did you say yes?	hit:4218_conv:8436_2_509
I haven't given an answer yet. I'm just not sure if it's a wise idea or not.	hit:4218_conv:8436_3_503
Where does she plan to go?	hit:4218_conv:8436_4_509
She says she's just going to meet some friends at the movies, but you know how teenagers are.	hit:4218_conv:8436_5_503
Boy, it was nice when I wasn't so poor	hit:4218_conv:8437_1_509
Money problems are never fun. Trust me, I know.	hit:4218_conv:8437_2_503
I'm sorry to hear that :( It'd be nice if work paid better	hit:4218_conv:8437_3_509
Yeah, definitely. Have you tried asking for a raise?	hit:4218_conv:8437_4_503
I was sad when I had to put my dog down last month	hit:4219_conv:8438_1_259
Oh no, I'm so so sorry. I've always had at least one pet throughout my life, and they're truly part of the family.	hit:4219_conv:8438_2_512
They are very much family. I cannot believe we get so attached.	hit:4219_conv:8438_3_259
Yes, they're honestly more dear to me than my friends. I hope you're doing okay - I'm sure your dog was very loved and had a wonderful life, so try to take comfort in that.	hit:4219_conv:8438_4_512
I was recently promoted at my job. I didn't expect it to happen, but I got it through hard work so I'm pretty excited about it!	hit:4219_conv:8439_1_512
That is great! Doing what?	hit:4219_conv:8439_2_259
Thank you! I'm now a district manager for a local chain of businesses. It's not my favorite thing to do, but the raise is great!	hit:4219_conv:8439_3_512
I bet that is nice and probably has good benefits!	hit:4219_conv:8439_4_259
I recently went on a long road trip. I wasn't too worried, though, because I packed everything I needed to make it as stress-free as possible. '	hit:4220_conv:8441_1_513
I can never go on long trips.	hit:4220_conv:8441_2_9
Why not? They used to bother me, but I'm finding that as I get older, they're not so bad.	hit:4220_conv:8441_3_513
I can no longer afford them, long trips cost the most.	hit:4220_conv:8441_4_9
That's unfortunate. I've come to enjoy taking a train as a frugal alternative to flying or driving. No wear and tear on your car, and you don't have to drive.	hit:4220_conv:8441_5_513
I kept laughing at myself for falling down	hit:4224_conv:8448_1_259
Oh no!. Are you ok? Must not have been a bad one if you were laughing?	hit:4224_conv:8448_2_297
Not bad but it was funny because I slipped on a banana peel!	hit:4224_conv:8448_3_259
How ironic. I kind of wish I were there to see it.	hit:4224_conv:8448_4_297
I compete in the Highland games around the country. I just got a new kilt and I look amazing. 	hit:4225_conv:8451_1_60
I am bad at every game.	hit:4225_conv:8451_2_9
It's a little different. It's based in picking up and throwing objects like logs, hammers that weight 70 pounds and stones that weight 70 pounds. Being Scottish it keeps me feeling at home.	hit:4225_conv:8451_3_60
I still could not do that, I am very weak human person.	hit:4225_conv:8451_4_9
You can do anything you set your mind to.	hit:4225_conv:8451_5_60
I've been very stressed out at work. I had it in my budget so I hired a new office manager. I'm having issues trusting her.	hit:4226_conv:8453_1_60
Do what i did, quit the job and live at home with mom.	hit:4226_conv:8453_2_9
I wish. My mom kicked me out at 14 and I've only seen her a handful of times since over the last 20 years.	hit:4226_conv:8453_3_60
I still thing living with a relative is the cheapest way to go.	hit:4226_conv:8453_4_9
I actually really want to buy a van and live in it but my wife said no.	hit:4226_conv:8453_5_60
I just pulled up my student loan bill. I've been out of school 10 years and still owe 75k.	hit:4228_conv:8456_1_60
That's awful! Luckily I paid all mine off, but I know many people still struggle with it	hit:4228_conv:8456_2_234
It started off at 150k so I've paid a lot but it's still crazy. Make me think I would have been better off to just go work construction or something instead of college. 	hit:4228_conv:8456_3_60
Yea...the education costs are atrocious and, honestly, not even worth it on my opinion. It's just the piece of paper. The material you learn from them can be learned online for free or nearly so	hit:4228_conv:8456_4_234
I agree. I feel like I've learned just as much or more from MOCC's since then.	hit:4228_conv:8456_5_60
My boss is piling on the work but keeping my pay the same. He claims he can't afford to pay me more, but I know that's not true.	hit:4229_conv:8459_1_512
Typical of most companies.  Ask employees to do more and pay less.	hit:4229_conv:8459_2_274
Yep, it's so frustrating. I'm ready to shake up the system but I feel limited in what I can do, besides quit.	hit:4229_conv:8459_3_512
What kind of job do you have?	hit:4229_conv:8459_4_274
I'm so shocked, my pants fell down in public	hit:4231_conv:8463_1_509
I'm sorry, did anyone see?	hit:4231_conv:8463_2_322
I'm hoping not, but it's possible	hit:4231_conv:8463_3_509
I hope you would wear a belt next time.	hit:4231_conv:8463_4_322
LOL Yes, I learned my lesson	hit:4231_conv:8463_5_509
My best friend has the best job ever. She is paid to travel the world full time and write Blogs on different locations.	hit:4232_conv:8464_1_60
That sounds like a blast.  Compared to my job LOL.  	hit:4232_conv:8464_2_160
Yes, I know. Ever day I drive an hour to the same place that is slowly killing me inside and she is jetting off to explore.	hit:4232_conv:8464_3_60
I'm sorry.  I like my job but its certainly not like hers!	hit:4232_conv:8464_4_160
Just finished my budget for the week. Woowa, I'm in trouble it's going to be a rice and beans week.	hit:4234_conv:8469_1_60
LOL.  Be careful.. thats a ton of carbs.	hit:4234_conv:8469_2_160
It's better then the alternative. One good meal then water and ketchup soup the rest of the week.	hit:4234_conv:8469_3_60
eww LOL	hit:4234_conv:8469_4_160
Yea, Rice and beans is so much better then that. 	hit:4234_conv:8469_5_60
I just had my birthday, and my family and fiance did everything they could to make it special. I don't have much, but I'm thankful to have them at least.	hit:4235_conv:8470_1_512
Happy Birthday!	hit:4235_conv:8470_2_274
Thank you! I hope your birthday, whenever it is, is awesome as well!	hit:4235_conv:8470_3_512
What all did they do for you?	hit:4235_conv:8470_4_274
Got a big bouquet of flowers, they took me out to eat (lunch and dinner), and we went to the drive-in to top it off :)	hit:4235_conv:8470_5_512
I was proud when my dog learned to sit.	hit:4236_conv:8472_1_259

How long will it be going on?|Omg, Thankfully he wasn't hurt. |Barney was the name of my hamster.|I do too but it's natural to get envious of others sometimes, don't put yourself down over it.|That is awesome.

What festival was it?|That sounds like a great idea!|Yeah, that is a scary thing to think about too|Wow, great job so far, kep up the great parenting!|That was great of him!|That sounds perfect|I bet it was.

What business is it?|its really so rude. ugh im sorry |Were you star struck?|It's not fair, eh.

All of your hard work paid off!| and got upset with you?|That's annoying, are you going to talk to them about it?|Well congratulations! I hope your students appreciate you as much as they should.|That is smart, I would recommend a nintendo switch!|Did you eventually get it out? I would have been flipping bonkers! |Aw, i am missing my high school now that you said it|That's great. It's nice to have people so close to you. It really helps in bad times|I do not yet but hope to one day. I think you will be a great parent! |That sucks, how much is it?|Really, where was this parade at?

Never been happier! |Animal accidents can be really bad!|Interesting... well then at least that leaves the possibility for something good instead.

I bet he knew he was in trouble. Did you get him a crate?|That sounds creepy! Is there any chance someone could start escorting you to your car? There is strength in numbers!|I see what you mean about a parents group. I joined a dads group in facebook and it's full of people who complain non stop about  being an adult. |If telling yourself that makes you feel better, I found all of that to be much more stressful. To be completely honest with you I think people invented stories about the after life to make them more comfortable with death.|Oh, that's a big one. I bet it caused a lot of damage|i am so glad that you did |That's too bad. What happened? Is everyone OK?|Oh no! Did it end up raining? Did you take rain gear?|I believe you will just continue doing what you've already done.|I think if everybody in the world offered a hand of help to one another, we would not have much problem|Oh, no. Did you take it back or keep it|So, did you get it?|Wow, watching kids grow up is hard.

I wonder what else you can train him to do.|Haha everyone has to do that once. Can you tell me a great story about the party?|Yeah, It bothers me when people don't take responsibility for their actions.|I wish yo the best|Oh. How old is he?|Oh, that's terrific! What a great feeling that is, to be appreciated and valued!|What's your approach? Does humor ever work....? You know, like wearing a dunce cap while holding a huge bouquet of flowers? Or going John Cusack and holding a boombox overhead, playing your"" song?|I can relate to that!  Yeah, my wife with my credit card, lol!|OH man! Yeah I would of felt the same way!|My parents worked in them, so I am used to them.|OK. I hope you are now fine?|Hard work always pays off! Keep it up.|Take her out to dinner! That would be a treat.|We even had to put something heavy on top of the lid to keep it from getting in it. Hopefully that will work for now until you figure something out.|I completely agree, having complete control over your diet is amazing and has a ton of benefits|Oh no. Did you guys talk about it?|Did you let him?|i'm glad you were in a good mood.|No! I'm sure you are not as monster-ish as you think!|They really can't. It's still no excuse though.|A puppy!  That's so exciting!  Are you going to keep it?|Aw well it's likely bipolar- I know a phew. They have a hard time even on meds. |Did you feel very emasculated by this?|I would go with the bigfoot option. You can get a costume on the cheap on ebay nowadays. I've used that tactic countless times and it has never failed!|Arghhhhhhhhh! I soooo feel for you and have been there. Have y'all had the chance to talk about it? (Or do you even want to?)|That is great accomplishment! I wish you well on your new path in life!|Nice! I hope you get it, I'll cross my fingers for you also! Do you think you got a good chance?|that's great, i'm glad she's nice to you.|Were you able to get it back?|That is awesome!  What are you studying|That is great. That should be good insurance. Are you generaly happy with it?|That is no good!  I guess it is time for you to go shopping!|Oh man, I've definitely had a few coworkers like that myself before. What does she even talk about?|Did you find your shoe in the end?|What was she referring to then?|That was lucky. Losing power is bad, but at least that was it. Scary situation. |THAT IS TERRIFYING. Until the end of your story.. then I laughed so hard I cried. But that is so relatable. I've been terrified of my own shadow more than once.|Wait, you forgot you're vegetarian? That must've been pretty shocking|Oh, I am sorry for your loss|Nope, they only know how to touch screens.|That is good.  Money is no good if you are not healthy enough to enjoy it.|I'm sorry to hear that. Hopefully something better is coming along for you soon.|yes, i understood the first time.|I did the same thing today, so you are not alone in your behavior friend!|Good for her! Moms get a lot done lol|Yes first heart brake is so hard, I feel for you, something similar happened to me with my first boyfriend.|I totally get that. I majored in business but sometimes I wish I majored in engineering. I'm kind of glad I didn't though. It's hard!|Congrats! Did you do it because of football season?|Sounds like an interesting job.  I'm sure it's taxing on the family though.|That seems like a valid reason to be scared of going into the caves!|practice makes perfect|What did you pass?|All that outside noise can become so soothing if you left it.|That sounds nice, having someone prepare a meal for you can be fun.|I know what you mean, that happened to me when I left for college a few years ago.|what kind of pizza?|oh no. What do you do for that?|lol why do you have to steer clear?|What is the protest for?|Thank You. That is our next step we are moving from NYC to Miami after the baby. How can we find friends like yours? |well have you practiced interviewing? With that you can feel so much better!|Oh really? I will be checking it out. I would love to have some.|Sounds exciting.  But I would have been scared of howling monkeys too.  I am not sure why, but the term ""howling monkeys"" makes me giggle.|oh nice, what kind of memories?|Good for you. You can also call your friends to hang out if you have close ones|You are telling me you are a hoarder?|She is a special woman.|and did you knock it out of the park? |oh that explains it!|That is so sweet. It is wonderful to have things that bring back these beautiful memories. |What did you do?|Yeah, thats rough. I hate having to clean up mess that wasn't my fault."	hit:4299_conv:8599_1_509

Aw, I'm sorry, did you just forget or you were thinking about other things?	hit:4349_conv:8699_2_448
I didn't think he would mind.  But it was expensive, so maybe i should have asked.	hit:4349_conv:8699_3_327

Yes! I don't have a gun or anything!	hit:4357_conv:8714_3_327
I'm sure you are fine. I bet it is just a tree branch or something like that. Maybe a neighbor could go look for you.	hit:4357_conv:8714_4_228
I don't have any neighbors, and there are no trees there. 	hit:4357_conv:8714_5_327

I hate going to walmart. People just walk right out in front of you and don't even say excuse me!	hit:4364_conv:8729_1_327
Maybe they're very eager to go a certain item.	hit:4364_conv:8729_2_511
Maybe. It's that hunter gatherer mentality.  Get it before everyone else.	hit:4364_conv:8729_3_327
True, because regretfully I act that way sometimes too.	hit:4364_conv:8729_4_511
I guess I might too.	hit:4364_conv:8729_5_327
I love being lazy on weekends. It's nice to just relax and have nothing to worry about.	hit:4370_conv:8741_1_513
Yeah I hear you! Do you like to read or watch TV?	hit:4370_conv:8741_2_469
Both! I spend more time watching TV though. How about you?	hit:4370_conv:8741_3_513
I like to do both as well. TV if I'm feeling lazy, reading if I feel more ambitious. 	hit:4370_conv:8741_4_469
That's kind of how I am. What kind of TV shows do you like?	hit:4370_conv:8741_5_513

I called them and told them about it. They said the next pizza would be free. I said no thanks.	hit:4372_conv:8745_3_327

Yes indeed.  I think i am done with eating out for a while	hit:4372_conv:8745_5_327
Best way to ensure your food is clean and free of hair cook it yourself.	hit:4372_conv:8745_6_284
I recently went on a long trip by car. For the first time, it wasn't stressful because I packed everything I needed for it to run smoothly.	hit:4375_conv:8751_1_513

Wasn't that out a long time ago? It must've been super scary if you still remember it.	hit:4671_conv:9343_2_220
Yeah, it has been a while. I went at night, alone. So you can imagine the impact!	hit:4671_conv:9343_3_391
Wow, I wouldn't have been brave enough to do that!	hit:4671_conv:9343_4_220
I always feel a bit of jealousy when i see someone driving around in a red sports car	hit:4677_conv:9354_1_391
Yes, it is hard to see people with things you can't afford to buy for yourself.	hit:4677_conv:9354_2_340
I feel that way about red sports car only though. I have always dreamed of owning one as a kid.	hit:4677_conv:9354_3_391

I can see why! That's highly inappropriate.  	hit:4679_conv:9358_2_475
He seems to think otherwise for some reason. I am thinking about reporting him to the HR.	hit:4679_conv:9358_3_391
You should. He is obviously at the very least flirting with you and at worst harassing you	hit:4679_conv:9358_4_475
I am going out to dinner with my wife to a place we haven't been to since I proposed to her. I cant wait.	hit:4679_conv:9359_1_475

I'm so sorry to hear that. Do you have things of hers that remind you of her often? 	hit:4680_conv:9360_2_347
Yeah.. i have kept a collection of her things, just so that she always stays in my life.	hit:4680_conv:9360_3_391
That is beautiful that you have those things of hers. Mothers are very special people.	hit:4680_conv:9360_4_347

I have been to that, it is such a wonderful experience. You are going to love it!	hit:4680_conv:9361_2_391

I was heartbroken when my dog trevor died last month..	hit:4681_conv:9362_1_391
I'm sorry to hear about that. How did he die?	hit:4681_conv:9362_2_317

A friend of mine borrowed my mower this past weekend, which he brought back broken.	hit:4692_conv:9385_1_340
Did you ask him to replace it?	hit:4692_conv:9385_2_10
He said it wasn't his fault and it just stopped working. Of course the blade is bent, so I think he might be lying.	hit:4692_conv:9385_3_340
I agree with you there, I would ask him to pay honestly	hit:4692_conv:9385_4_10
My local animal shelter donated a dog to me because of my service connected disability. It was such a nice surprise 	hit:4696_conv:9393_1_475
That's nice. How  do you like the dog?	hit:4696_conv:9393_2_262
He is my best friend and I think he needs me as much as I need him.	hit:4696_conv:9393_3_475
That is so sweet. My apartments don't allow pets	hit:4696_conv:9393_4_262
I love when I go somewhere and for some reason or another it reminds me of my childhood. It makes me feel so good.	hit:4706_conv:9413_1_475
That is for sure, especially a smell that just throws you back	hit:4706_conv:9413_2_10
OMG yes! Sometimes it's a sound or just a feeling you get for no reason. It's like comfort food .lol	hit:4706_conv:9413_3_475
Exactly, sometimes I just smell a good barbeque and that brings me back to those summer days as a kid, life is great sometimes	hit:4706_conv:9413_4_10
I was suppose to go on vacation with my family last month, but I caught the flu and couldn't go.	hit:4713_conv:9427_1_340

Awww. Did you keep it?	hit:4723_conv:9446_2_262
Yes, we did. He was so cute we took him in, and now he is 9 years old.	hit:4723_conv:9446_3_340
Thats great. I know he appreciates it	hit:4723_conv:9446_4_262

My rabbit died last year, I miss her to this day	hit:4765_conv:9531_1_475
how old was it	hit:4765_conv:9531_2_271
I had her for about 10 years. 	hit:4765_conv:9531_3_475
they live that long ? interesting	hit:4765_conv:9531_4_271
Yeah, they can live to about 14 years if you take care of them right	hit:4765_conv:9531_5_475
So I asked my boss for a raise today.	hit:4771_conv:9542_1_503
How'd that go?	hit:4771_conv:9542_2_529
It went well, I'm pretty sure that I'll get it!	hit:4771_conv:9542_3_503
Well congratulations! That must have been nerve-wracking.	hit:4771_conv:9542_4_529
So my neighbor just bought a new car. I swear, he always gets really expensive stuff to show off how successful he is.	hit:4776_conv:9552_1_503
That stinks. Maybe he is going through something that only new stuff can solve	hit:4776_conv:9552_2_317
Maybe... but still. Now I feel like I need to buy one myself.	hit:4776_conv:9552_3_503
Do it! I bet you deserve it	hit:4776_conv:9552_4_317
Last year my wife got into an accident and we only had one car and I was so worried we wouldn't have a car to get to work	hit:4780_conv:9561_1_475
Did you make special arrangements so things went smoothly with one car?	hit:4780_conv:9561_2_506
We didn't have many options but the other persons insurance ended up taking care of it all so we got a rental and the car got fixed but i was so scared .	hit:4780_conv:9561_3_475
Well I am glad it worked out	hit:4780_conv:9561_4_506
Last night I found something in my son's room that made me so mad!	hit:4781_conv:9563_1_503
What did you find?!	hit:4781_conv:9563_2_506
Drugs! I found drugs. I can't believe this.	hit:4781_conv:9563_3_503
Oh no, are you going to talk to him about the dangers of drugs?	hit:4781_conv:9563_4_506
I definitely will. I bet he'll say that they aren't his, but I know better.	hit:4781_conv:9563_5_503
Do you remember that show I was telling you about the other day? It's getting a new season!	hit:4784_conv:9568_1_503
Remind me, which show was that?	hit:4784_conv:9568_2_527
The one with the three cops that can never agree with each other but end up solving the cases anyway. I'm so happy about this news!	hit:4784_conv:9568_3_503
That's so cool!  I'm gonna have to check it out	hit:4784_conv:9568_4_527
I was going through some boxes today, and I found a really old picture of me with my grandmother.	hit:4787_conv:9574_1_503
That's nice. Are you going to hang it up?	hit:4787_conv:9574_2_225
Yeah, definitely. It brings back really good memories.	hit:4787_conv:9574_3_503
Great, you've found an old treasure.	hit:4787_conv:9574_4_225
My girlfriend broke up with me recently...	hit:4789_conv:9578_1_503
I'm sorry. How long had you been together?	hit:4789_conv:9578_2_225
We were together for 3 years. I can't stand being alone.	hit:4789_conv:9578_3_503
Just try and get through each day, one at a time. Don't think too far ahead.	hit:4789_conv:9578_4_225
I keep hearing noises coming from my basement...	hit:4791_conv:9582_1_503
That sounds scary.  Are you going to investigate?	hit:4791_conv:9582_2_447
I want to, but I'm a bit scared. Maybe I should take something with me to defend myself, just in case.	hit:4791_conv:9582_3_503
If this were a movie, I'd be yelling at the screen for you to leave the house and not go down there.	hit:4791_conv:9582_4_447
I can't believe this! My son failed a really important test.	hit:4792_conv:9585_1_503
I am so sorry to hear that.  Is he planning to retake the test?	hit:4792_conv:9585_2_274
I sure hope so. Otherwise he might not be able to graduate.	hit:4792_conv:9585_3_503
What test?	hit:4792_conv:9585_4_274
It was a math test, it makes up a pretty large part of his grade.	hit:4792_conv:9585_5_503
They other day was my son's first day of school, and when I dropped him off it brought back so much memories.	hit:4794_conv:9588_1_250
That's great. Is that your only son?	hit:4794_conv:9588_2_244
Yes, he's my only son. I cant wait until he get's his first girlfriend like I did in middle school. Those were the days.	hit:4794_conv:9588_3_250
I'm sure the memories will be great	hit:4794_conv:9588_4_244
So I've been walking around all day with a huge hole in the back of my pants... I just found out about it.	hit:4795_conv:9591_1_503
Oh wow! Hopefully no one saw it	hit:4795_conv:9591_2_317
If they did, no one told me about it! So embarrassing.	hit:4795_conv:9591_3_503
Im sorry about that. Ive gone through that before. Laughter can be good medicine sometimes	hit:4795_conv:9591_4_317
So that new game that I've been looking forward to is coming out in a few weeks!	hit:4798_conv:9596_1_503
What is it called ?	hit:4798_conv:9596_2_225
Oh, I'm sure it's not one that you've heard of. I'm pretty excited though, I've been saving up money for it for a few months now.	hit:4798_conv:9596_3_503
Okay, well I guess I'm happy for you then.	hit:4798_conv:9596_4_225
Yesterday, I caught my neighbor letting his dog poop on my lawn. I had a few choice words for him.	hit:4799_conv:9598_1_250
That's understandable.  How receptive was he to your complaint?	hit:4799_conv:9598_2_447
He wasn't to happy about me confronting him. I told him if it happens again it might get physical.	hit:4799_conv:9598_3_250
Oh, so it got pretty serious.  I guess he needs to learn to respect boundaries.	hit:4799_conv:9598_4_447
I was going through some boxes in my attic today.	hit:4800_conv:9601_1_503
Did you find anything?	hit:4800_conv:9601_2_244
Yeah, I found some old toys from my childhood. So many memories came flooding back into my mind.	hit:4800_conv:9601_3_503
I bet that was very nostalgic for you.	hit:4800_conv:9601_4_244
I can't believe that my coworker got the promotion that I was going for. This is ridiculous.	hit:4802_conv:9604_1_503
That's a hard hit to take.  Why do you suspect they got it?	hit:4802_conv:9604_2_447
I honestly have no idea. I was definitely more deserving of that position.	hit:4802_conv:9604_3_503
So what are you going to do about?  Are you going to start looking for another place to work?	hit:4802_conv:9604_4_447
I really think that I might.	hit:4802_conv:9604_5_503
I'm so ashamed of myself. I made a big mistake on a project for work.	hit:4805_conv:9610_1_503
What did you mess up?	hit:4805_conv:9610_2_244
It was something for an important client. Now I'm afraid this is going to screw up my career.	hit:4805_conv:9610_3_503
I'm sure you'll be fine.  Have you made many similar mistakes in the past?	hit:4805_conv:9610_4_244
No, this is the first time I've messed up anything like this.	hit:4805_conv:9610_5_503
I wouldn't worry too much about it then.  Don't let it get you down.	hit:4805_conv:9610_6_244
I bought a used car a few years ago and found 500 dollars tucked in the back seat!	hit:4807_conv:9615_1_475
Wow, that's nice. I hope you treated yourself to something extravagant!	hit:4807_conv:9615_2_343
Oh I spent it on a few things. I was just surprised someone didn't find it when it was being cleaned.	hit:4807_conv:9615_3_475
I guess they didn't do as good a job as they should have, lol. Wish my car dealership had missed a few hundred bucks!	hit:4807_conv:9615_4_343
I know! made it not so bad that the car I traded in was a junker and not worth much lol	hit:4807_conv:9615_5_475
Well, it was worth $500! That's about what my car's worth these days - had it for years. Still runs great tho'.	hit:4807_conv:9615_6_343
I'm going camping with my kids this weekend.	hit:4809_conv:9619_1_503
How fun! In a tent or an RV?	hit:4809_conv:9619_2_523
In a tent. I just have to make extra sure that I pack all of the supplies that we'll need.	hit:4809_conv:9619_3_503
Don't forget a first aid kit! We always need those on camping trips!	hit:4809_conv:9619_4_523
On my way home today there was someone in the fast lane going so slow in front of me.	hit:4823_conv:9646_1_475
Ugh, that's so annoying.  How long did you have to follow behind them?	hit:4823_conv:9646_2_527
about 5 miles. there was too much trafic in the slow lane, couldn't get over	hit:4823_conv:9646_3_475
I hope you weren't late for anything important!	hit:4823_conv:9646_4_527
I was watching television earlier today when I came across a channel that was showing a bunch of cartoons that I loved when I was younger.	hit:4827_conv:9654_1_503
memory lane right there! which cartoons? 	hit:4827_conv:9654_2_11
It was a whole bunch of different ones from the 90's. Man, they really reminded me of my childhood.	hit:4827_conv:9654_3_503
Very cool I havent seen the older style cartoons myself in years.	hit:4827_conv:9654_4_11
I keep getting strange phone calls. It's creeping me out.	hit:4829_conv:9659_1_503
That would creep me out too what kind of calls?? 	hit:4829_conv:9659_2_11
The person on the other end just keeps making really weird sounds until I hang up. I'm not sure what I should do about it.	hit:4829_conv:9659_3_503
Alright that would creep me out too. Block the number or change yours!! weird. 	hit:4829_conv:9659_4_11
My boyfriend told me he quit drinking, but I just found a bunch of empty liquor bottles he hid in his room.	hit:4832_conv:9664_1_512
Uh oh. Are you going to confront him about it?	hit:4832_conv:9664_2_503
Absolutely, but it probably won't go well. He needs help but he won't accept it.	hit:4832_conv:9664_3_512
Well I hope that he actually listens to you this time and gets help.	hit:4832_conv:9664_4_503
Yay! I'm finally getting a promotion at work!	hit:4832_conv:9665_1_503
Congratulations, that's awesome! I hope you're getting a raise too!	hit:4832_conv:9665_2_512

Hope you treat yourself to celebrate, you deserve it!	hit:4832_conv:9665_4_512
So I might be up for a promotion soon at work!	hit:4836_conv:9672_1_503
That sounds amazing! When will you find out? 	hit:4836_conv:9672_2_11
Soon. There are several other people trying to get the same position, but I'm pretty hopeful that things will work out in my favor.	hit:4836_conv:9672_3_503
You sound positive so I am sure you will get it!!! 	hit:4836_conv:9672_4_11

I bet.  It is nice to have a day off every now and then	hit:4844_conv:9688_2_282
it definitely is	hit:4844_conv:9688_3_44
I like having days off to do absolutly nothing.  It helps with stress.	hit:4844_conv:9688_4_282
Ugh, my cat keeps climbing up the curtains in my room.	hit:4846_conv:9693_1_503
That's the worst.  Is it damaging the curtains too much?	hit:4846_conv:9693_2_310
Yeah, he's tearing them up. I really wish he'd stop.	hit:4846_conv:9693_3_503
Is there anything you can put on them or near them to stop him?	hit:4846_conv:9693_4_310
I'm not sure, but I'm going to try to find something that will do that.	hit:4846_conv:9693_5_503
We've decided to adopt another cat from the shelter!	hit:4847_conv:9695_1_512
That is great! Adopt, don't shop! Always a great motto!	hit:4847_conv:9695_2_99
Agreed, that's my motto! This is a high-kill shelter too, so we'll definitely be saving a life :)	hit:4847_conv:9695_3_512

thats strange, my dog will eat anything lol	hit:4853_conv:9707_2_44
Yeah, that's what I thought about mine too. I bought a huge bag of the stuff, too. It's so irritating.	hit:4853_conv:9707_3_503
maybe he will start warming up to it soon	hit:4853_conv:9707_4_44
I certainly hope so.	hit:4853_conv:9707_5_503
My coworker gave a really nice presentation at work today.	hit:4856_conv:9712_1_503
About what?!	hit:4856_conv:9712_2_99
Oh it was just boring work stuff, about a client. But I was really awed by the amount of work that she put into it.	hit:4856_conv:9712_3_503
That's awesome. I'm glad she did well.	hit:4856_conv:9712_4_99
I've been working hard and doing a great job for several months, but still no raise.	hit:4858_conv:9716_1_512
thats always a bummer when you put in such work and get nothing in return 	hit:4858_conv:9716_2_11
Yeah, especially when my boss promised to pay me more. Might be time to quit!	hit:4858_conv:9716_3_512
Oh I just quit a few weeks ago due to a similar situation actually! Never been happier! 	hit:4858_conv:9716_4_11
im nervous about taking a test soon	hit:4860_conv:9721_1_44
Did you study for it or are you winging it?	hit:4860_conv:9721_2_277
i feel pretty prepared	hit:4860_conv:9721_3_44
Don't worry then.  You did you part!! I'm sure you will do fine!	hit:4860_conv:9721_4_277
My roommate is gone for the week, on a business trip. It's way too quiet around here.	hit:4862_conv:9724_1_503
Maybe you should try and have a party?	hit:4862_conv:9724_2_291
That's a good idea. I can't stand being alone in this place much longer.	hit:4862_conv:9724_3_503
Yes being alone is not very fun.	hit:4862_conv:9724_4_291
My birthday is coming up next week. I'm really looking forward to it.	hit:4865_conv:9731_1_503
What will your new age be?	hit:4865_conv:9731_2_291
I'll be turning 35. And some friends are coming that I haven't seen in years, it'll be great to see them again.	hit:4865_conv:9731_3_503
You should have a great time, congrats on the new age!	hit:4865_conv:9731_4_291
My wife and I got a divorce. The house is so quiet without her and the kids being here.	hit:4866_conv:9733_1_340
I went through a similar thing a few years back.  Everything seemed hollow to me.  How long has it been?	hit:4866_conv:9733_2_447
About two years now and everything still seems very odd to me.	hit:4866_conv:9733_3_340
If your depressed, speak to someone.  If it's just adjusting to the change, that comes in time.	hit:4866_conv:9733_4_447
Uh oh. I'm in trouble now.	hit:4868_conv:9737_1_503
Why is it that you are in trouble?	hit:4868_conv:9737_2_291
I lost a really important document at work... telling my boss is going to be so embarrassing.	hit:4868_conv:9737_3_503
Can you just replace the document?	hit:4868_conv:9737_4_291
If only it were that easy. It had several signatures on it.	hit:4868_conv:9737_5_503
"There's a creepy guy that comes by at work that won't stop bothering me. He writes crazy letters, and keeps calling on the phone ""just to chat"" with me."	hit:4869_conv:9738_1_512
I would be reporting that to the police for sure. 	hit:4869_conv:9738_2_11
I tried. They said they can't do anything unless he actually tries to physically harm me, which is insane to me.	hit:4869_conv:9738_3_512
Thats true right.. i forgot how stupid the law can be sometimes. Thats insane. 	hit:4869_conv:9738_4_11
My father was diagnosed with stage 4 brain cancer.	hit:4872_conv:9745_1_340
Oh no! I am so sorry to hear that. That must be very difficult for you and your family.	hit:4872_conv:9745_2_320
Yes it was. It only took a few short months and my father passed away due to it being inoperable.	hit:4872_conv:9745_3_340
I am so sorry for your loss. I hope that you find peace in this difficult time.	hit:4872_conv:9745_4_320
I'm starting a new job next week! Can't wait to be doing something different for a change!	hit:4873_conv:9746_1_512
That's great. What will you be doing at your new job?	hit:4873_conv:9746_2_340
Thanks! Graphic design mostly. At my old job I was a manager and it was horrible.	hit:4873_conv:9746_3_512
Sometimes being a manager is the worst job you can have at a place, you seem to be the one who gets blamed for everything.	hit:4873_conv:9746_4_340
Recently, I got passed over for a promotion at my job.	hit:4873_conv:9747_1_340
Aw man, that sucks. Promotions usually aren't given fairly in my experience. Was that the case for you too?	hit:4873_conv:9747_2_512
No, the guy that got it was qualified, it's just I really wanted the job. It would have really help my career.	hit:4873_conv:9747_3_340
I'll keep my fingers crossed for you that you get that promotion next time!	hit:4873_conv:9747_4_512
I bought a scratch off lottery ticket the other day, and won $5000.	hit:4876_conv:9753_1_340
That is amazingly lucky! good for you!	hit:4876_conv:9753_2_99
I almost passed out, I have never won so much money before.	hit:4876_conv:9753_3_340
That is great! I wish I was lucky like that!	hit:4876_conv:9753_4_99
Had to take my cat to the vet. He's got a bad injury on his paw and it hasn't been healing.	hit:4879_conv:9758_1_512
Awh poor baby.. I am sure itll get better now tho! How old is he? 	hit:4879_conv:9758_2_11
He's 8 years old. They're going to have to put him down - turns out he has feline aids :(	hit:4879_conv:9758_3_512
Ugh noooo! Thats terrible i am so sorry. :( 	hit:4879_conv:9758_4_11
One of my art pieces has been chosen to be put in a exhibition!	hit:4884_conv:9769_1_512
I would be so excited! Did they pay you for it? 	hit:4884_conv:9769_2_313
Haven't been paid for it yet, but people that visit are welcome to put in an offer for anything they see! Fingers crossed someone wants mine!	hit:4884_conv:9769_3_512
Hopefully! that would be so amazing! 	hit:4884_conv:9769_4_313
I was enjoying the morning watching the kids play in the pool.	hit:4890_conv:9780_1_13
That sounds like such a fun, peaceful morning. So jealous you have a pool, it's been scorching outside!	hit:4890_conv:9780_2_512
Well it's only a kiddie pool, kids are very little. It was a very nice morning.	hit:4890_conv:9780_3_13
Ah okay, nice for the kiddos then. They grow up fast, so hold onto these moments while you can:)	hit:4890_conv:9780_4_512
As a child, I was mean to my sister all the time and I still feel awful about it.	hit:4890_conv:9781_1_512
Aw, well when your younger you don't do those things on purpose. I think everyone is mean to their siblings every now and then.	hit:4890_conv:9781_2_13
True, but she's very sensitive. I'm sure it still bothers her. I try to make up for it today, but I never can take those things back.	hit:4890_conv:9781_3_512
Have you talked to her about it? Maybe she doesn't really think about it anymore.	hit:4890_conv:9781_4_13
my husband and i lostour daughter 2years ago and i don't care to celebrate mother's day and he still impressed me with a gift	hit:4892_conv:9784_1_417
I am so sorry to hear about your loss. What did he get you?	hit:4892_conv:9784_2_99
he got my favorite flower, an orchid a card and made dinner 	hit:4892_conv:9784_3_417
That was very nice of him. I'm glad you have a nice husband.	hit:4892_conv:9784_4_99
thanks	hit:4892_conv:9784_5_417
Went to get an oil change the other day. Turns out I didn't need one for another 1,000 miles, and I felt like such a fool.	hit:4893_conv:9787_1_512
Well better to be sooner than later on something like that. Dont be hard on yourself. 	hit:4893_conv:9787_2_11
Agreed, and it had been 5 months so I figured I was due. The mechanic was really condescending which was what made it embarrassing!	hit:4893_conv:9787_3_512
Thats so silly its none of his worry. He needs to hush up. lol 	hit:4893_conv:9787_4_11
My cat somehow managed to lock himself in the bathroom last night. I still can't figure out how he did it.	hit:4899_conv:9798_1_512
Wow! He sounds like a super smart cat! How did you get him out of there?	hit:4899_conv:9798_2_209
He is! Well, both smart and dumb haha. Had to use a knitting needle to pick the lock!	hit:4899_conv:9798_3_512
Well at least you managed to save him!	hit:4899_conv:9798_4_209
I've got a coworker with zero social skills, and it's driving me batty. She can't seem to tell no one wants to listen to her talk for 30 minutes straight.	hit:4901_conv:9802_1_512
Oh man, I've definitely had a few coworkers like that myself before. What does she even talk about?	hit:4901_conv:9802_2_209
If you make a comment on anything, say cats, she'll go into a monologue about everything she's ever learned about a cat (most of it wrong).	hit:4901_conv:9802_3_512
That's the worst! Some people, once they get started, they just can't stop themselves. It's like opening a can of Pringles.	hit:4901_conv:9802_4_209
We had an annoying client the other day, and I went to the breakroom to complain about her to my coworkers (thinking she couldn't hear).	hit:4904_conv:9808_1_512
Did it feel good to get it out?	hit:4904_conv:9808_2_473
It did at first, until I left the room and saw she was sitting right by the door where she could hear everything! It was humiliating and I felt really bad for her after that.	hit:4904_conv:9808_3_512
Oh no, that's awkward! Did you get in trouble for it?	hit:4904_conv:9808_4_473
I found some baby kittens in my yard, their mother was dead. I nursed them to health and found homes for them.	hit:4904_conv:9809_1_473
That's heartbreaking, but you're amazing for doing that. Cats are my favorite and I've rescued many animals. It's a lot of work.	hit:4904_conv:9809_2_512
They are my favorite, too. I love how independent they are.	hit:4904_conv:9809_3_473
Yes, and when they love you it feels special, because they don't love everyone like dogs do. You've racked up a lot of good karma for saving them!	hit:4904_conv:9809_4_512
Finances aren't great right now. I've got a lot of bills that are overdue, but I can't afford to pay them :(	hit:4905_conv:9810_1_512
I'm there too. Struggling each day. It really gets old.	hit:4905_conv:9810_2_225
I'm sorry we're both in this situation. It really sucks, and it feels unfair because it's not for lack of effort.	hit:4905_conv:9810_3_512
Yeah, that's right. I've been pushing 70 hours working a week for as long as I can remember. Hold out, maybe it'll change.	hit:4905_conv:9810_4_225
I was out of school for over a year and thought i forgot everything before taking this big test	hit:4906_conv:9812_1_417
You would be so suprised at how much stays all the way in the nooks and crannies of your brain when you take a break!	hit:4906_conv:9812_2_227
I know it was nerve wrecking but studying all the time and i mean al the time paid off 	hit:4906_conv:9812_3_417
Im glad it paid off for you, you must be super proud!	hit:4906_conv:9812_4_227
A few years back I got laid off from my job because they were losing too much money. It broke me, I really loved that job.	hit:4907_conv:9814_1_473
Oh no, I am so sorry. What did you do?	hit:4907_conv:9814_2_320
To be honest, I fell into a pretty deep depression. No one wanted to hire me. It was tough.	hit:4907_conv:9814_3_473
That is tough. That must have been quite the trying time. Did you eventually find work?	hit:4907_conv:9814_4_320
I did, yeah. And strangely enough, the company hired me back a few years later when they were doing better cashflow-wise. 	hit:4907_conv:9814_5_473
im stoked to go see some old friends tomorrow night	hit:4910_conv:9821_1_44
Good, how long has it been since you saw them last?	hit:4910_conv:9821_2_225
about a year and a half!	hit:4910_conv:9821_3_44
I hope you all have some fun.	hit:4910_conv:9821_4_225
I'm SO ready for fall - it's been incredibly hot all summer, and I need my favorite season to hurry up & get here!	hit:4911_conv:9823_1_512
Oh yes, fall is definitely my favorite season as well! I love fall scents!	hit:4911_conv:9823_2_209
Me too! Wearing comfy sweaters, snuggling up with a hot drink, and fall smell on the air...can't wait for it!	hit:4911_conv:9823_3_512
It is the best season, by far! Plus, Halloween!	hit:4911_conv:9823_4_209
A bunch of fruit flies appeared in my apartment out of nowhere the other day. I think it's because of some old veggies in my fridge. Totally gross.	hit:4914_conv:9828_1_473
Oh man, those things are awful and reproduce like crazy.  We left our house for a week and came back to tons of them everywhere! The best trick is putting a little apple cider vinegar in a jar, a drop of dish soap on top of that and cover it with cling wrap and put holes in it.  They will gravitate toward it and you'll catch a bunch! Just keep changing it every few days.	hit:4914_conv:9828_2_438
Thanks for the tip, I will try that! I cleaned out the fridge and most of them seemed to just go away. I have no idea where they go but don't really care either as long as they're gone!	hit:4914_conv:9828_3_473
Seriously, gone is good.  They do have bacteria on them and lay their eggs on fruit and veggies and the larva burrow into the fruit or veggie so its good you trashed it all. Glad you're free of them!	hit:4914_conv:9828_4_438
I'm getting married next year! Hoping everything goes smoothly and we get the wedding we want to have.	hit:4915_conv:9830_1_512
That is so exciting! It can be stressful and expensive planning a wedding.	hit:4915_conv:9830_2_228
Boy are you right about that. I was really excited during the early planning stages, but it's been stressful ever since.	hit:4915_conv:9830_3_512
It really gets stressful when you get down to the last minute. You are always so worried you are going to forget something.	hit:4915_conv:9830_4_228
My friends went ahead and gave me a baby shower that I didn't know about.	hit:4916_conv:9833_1_13
oh that was nice of them	hit:4916_conv:9833_2_63
Yeah, they had told my husband about it so he could get me there.	hit:4916_conv:9833_3_13
haha thats pretty fun	hit:4916_conv:9833_4_63
I have an adorable hamster that doesn't look like he's doing well. He is on the old side for hamsters, and I'm worried he won't live much longer.	hit:4918_conv:9836_1_512
Oh no, I am sorry to hear that. I hope that he gets to feeling better. How old is he?	hit:4918_conv:9836_2_320
Thank you, me too! He's a little over 2 years old. I'd hate to lose him, but they usually don't live more than 2-3 years.	hit:4918_conv:9836_3_512
Oh I see, I can understand your concern. Perhaps he will live longer than most hamsters!	hit:4918_conv:9836_4_320
I went back to work for my former company recently. They laid me off a few years ago when things were tough. Coming back was a little scary but I was thrilled!	hit:4919_conv:9839_1_473
That is awesome!  I would be really excited if I were in yyour shoes!	hit:4919_conv:9839_2_277
Yes, that's exactly how I felt. I suspected they'd been in trouble for a while so when they asked me to come back and help them out it felt really good.	hit:4919_conv:9839_3_473
I hope you go far in your job!  Good luck!	hit:4919_conv:9839_4_277
Thank you!	hit:4919_conv:9839_5_473
im upset that my neighbor's dog is sick	hit:4921_conv:9843_1_44
That is quite upsetting. Do you know what ails it?	hit:4921_conv:9843_2_320
no they are at the vet now	hit:4921_conv:9843_3_44
Well I certainly hope that the dog gets to feeling better. Are you close friends with this canine companion?	hit:4921_conv:9843_4_320
Well i had spent the good part of a week organising the best weekend away with my hubby for our 10th wedding anniversary. Spa day, great dinner, concert and of course the parents were booked to mind the kids for the weekend.  However all did not go to plan...	hit:4924_conv:9848_1_208
Oh no, what happened? Hopefully the whole weekend didn't get ruined!	hit:4924_conv:9848_2_473
Well unfortunately the day before we were due to go my little 2 year old daughter woke up covered in spots.  As the day went on more and more appeared and she had a roaring temperature.  We realised she had chickenpox.  She was feeling so miserable and of course all she wanted was her mummy and daddy.  It was a bit depressing and part of me was devastated but our weekend away was not to be.  Sure kids always come first dont they?!	hit:4924_conv:9848_3_208
Poor little thing, chicken pox are the worst. On the bright side, you still got to spend your anniversary with your husband, just not, you know, in the way you hoped. Hope you guys get to have a make-up weekend soon!	hit:4924_conv:9848_4_473
Very true and thats the way to look at it. I was a bit dispirited but the hotel were great and re-arranged it for us and to be honest I could never have left my baby when she was poorly. The best made plans dont always work out when you have kids, but hey I wouldnt change them for the world.	hit:4924_conv:9848_5_208
My neighbor has a brand new Tesla and every time I look at it I get so envious. I know it's stupid, I should be happy for him that he has such a cool car.	hit:4924_conv:9849_1_473
Wow thats nice.  What do you drive?	hit:4924_conv:9849_2_208
Well that's the thing, I don't. I bike everywhere. Don't get me wrong, I love my bike and it's a great way to stay fit. 	hit:4924_conv:9849_3_473
You have to think of the positives.  Just because they have a new car doesnt mean their life is great.  They could be watching you wishing they were fit and healthy like you are.	hit:4924_conv:9849_4_208
That is a really good way to put it, I will definitely keep that in mind next time I find myself pining after his car.	hit:4924_conv:9849_5_473
lol and some day you might you buy your own new Tesla, if you feel like it!	hit:4924_conv:9849_6_208
A Tesla with a bike rack!	hit:4924_conv:9849_7_473
Exactly!	hit:4924_conv:9849_8_208
I'm happy my package just arrived	hit:4926_conv:9853_1_44
oh thats nice	hit:4926_conv:9853_2_63
im glad it came earlier	hit:4926_conv:9853_3_44
yea i would be to	hit:4926_conv:9853_4_63
I'm feeling nostalgic today	hit:4927_conv:9855_1_44
Why's that?	hit:4927_conv:9855_2_99
I found some old keepsakes in the basement ealier	hit:4927_conv:9855_3_44
Nostalgia is a weird feeling.	hit:4927_conv:9855_4_99
I've got a fun weekend coming up, and I'm really looking forward to it!	hit:4929_conv:9859_1_512
Nice, what do you have planned?	hit:4929_conv:9859_2_511
Going to the drive-in, out to eat, and probably minigolf. Nothing particularly special, just haven't had fun in awhile!	hit:4929_conv:9859_3_512
Sound great, I'm happy for you!	hit:4929_conv:9859_4_511
I recently had a project of mine recognized in a national publication!	hit:4930_conv:9860_1_473
Wow!  That must feel great!  You should be proud of this accomplishment.  People can go their whole lives without ever being published!	hit:4930_conv:9860_2_277
It felt amazing to be recognized for my work, and in a publication I respect to boot! 	hit:4930_conv:9860_3_473
Congratulations!  I wish I could be published.	hit:4930_conv:9860_4_277
Well I certainly wasn't expecting it so who knows, maybe one day you will!	hit:4930_conv:9860_5_473
I am going to Disney next year. I want to write a list of everything to bring.	hit:4932_conv:9864_1_13
What are some things you will bring?	hit:4932_conv:9864_2_511
I'm not really sure. I think if I write things out that I could possibly need I won't forget anything.	hit:4932_conv:9864_3_13
It's a good idea to write thing down that you might forget.	hit:4932_conv:9864_4_511
Things have been rough for me lately, but thankfully I've got family and a fiance that are helping me through it.	hit:4933_conv:9866_1_512
What is wrong? Are you okay?	hit:4933_conv:9866_2_99
I'm in a lot of debt thanks to my car needing expensive repairs, and haven't been able to afford it. It's pretty depressing not being able to pay your bills :/	hit:4933_conv:9866_3_512
I am so sorry. I hope you get all the help you need.	hit:4933_conv:9866_4_99
the rain today is frustrating	hit:4934_conv:9868_1_44
We have been getting a lot of rain as well. I have to mow my lawn so much.	hit:4934_conv:9868_2_139
im not a fan of it at all	hit:4934_conv:9868_3_44
Yeah I know what you mean. I can't wait for the rainy season to end.	hit:4934_conv:9868_4_139
The other day I was riding my bike and this woman ran a stop sign, nearly hitting me. Thank goodness I was paying attention and was able to stop in time.	hit:4936_conv:9872_1_473
Oh my goodness, I've almost gotten hit while on a bike before and it's terrifying. I'm so glad you're alright!	hit:4936_conv:9872_2_512
I wish people would pay more attention. I try to do my best to follow the rules of the road both when I'm on my bike and in a car.	hit:4936_conv:9872_3_473
Ditto. It's not hard to do, and so many lives would be saved if people would just follow the rules. I'll send good vibes out so nothing bad happens to you in the future!	hit:4936_conv:9872_4_512
Thank you, I appreciate that!	hit:4936_conv:9872_5_473
My boyfriend proposed to me, and I accepted! I thought he didn't want to get married so it was a welcome surprise.	hit:4936_conv:9873_1_512
Wow, congratulations! Have you guys set a date yet?	hit:4936_conv:9873_2_473
Thank you! We're hoping to get married sometime next year, but man weddings are expensive. It may be further off than I'd like!	hit:4936_conv:9873_3_512
Oh I feel you, I used to work in the wedding industry. It's crazy how much it costs even for the most basic wedding.	hit:4936_conv:9873_4_473
I just had my birthday and I ate WAY too much. Had a good time, but boy do I feel bad for all of that food. I'm supposed to be eating healthier!	hit:4940_conv:9881_1_512
I know exactly how that happens. Sometimes the food is just too good to pass up.	hit:4940_conv:9881_2_139
No kidding. Had free refills on a root beer float too, and how could I say no to that?	hit:4940_conv:9881_3_512
Well I say go for it. It is only your birthday once a year. The other 364 days can make up for it.	hit:4940_conv:9881_4_139
i am pleased with the day im having today	hit:4947_conv:9895_1_44
Glad to hear you are having a good day. Wish every day was like that.	hit:4947_conv:9895_2_139
me too but we wouldnt appreciate the good days if it werent for the bad	hit:4947_conv:9895_3_44
That is true. It puts things in context.	hit:4947_conv:9895_4_139
Every night before bed, we read the Bible to our son. I love when he relates what he learned to real life.	hit:4950_conv:9901_1_26
That is really awesome! That is so important to be involved in his life like that. 	hit:4950_conv:9901_2_387
It is. And shows that he is listening. 	hit:4950_conv:9901_3_26
It does! Kids can understand things about the bible that most adults overlook. 	hit:4950_conv:9901_4_387
Our mail carrier keeps leaving packages outside instead of putting them in the lobby.	hit:4968_conv:9937_1_473
that is frustrating, especially if the weather isnt ideal 	hit:4968_conv:9937_2_524
Exactly! It rained the other day and my package was totally ruined.	hit:4968_conv:9937_3_473
that is unfortunate, im sorry that happened!	hit:4968_conv:9937_4_524
Thank you! At least I was able to get it replaced.	hit:4968_conv:9937_5_473
My friend left my front door open when she was house-sitting for me. My cat snuck out and was killed.	hit:4974_conv:9948_1_473
That isn't good. Are you mad at your friend?	hit:4974_conv:9948_2_4
I was really upset at the time but once I had some time I realized it was an honest mistake. She felt really bad about it.	hit:4974_conv:9948_3_473
Are you going to get another cat?	hit:4974_conv:9948_4_4
When I'm ready, I think yes.	hit:4974_conv:9948_5_473
I can't wait for it to be Christmas already. Just thinking about that time of year makes me really happy.	hit:4980_conv:9961_1_473
I feel the same way as well!  I get really excited thinking about decorating and giving gifts!	hit:4980_conv:9961_2_277
Exactly! And the food, and friends. All of it is just so lovely.	hit:4980_conv:9961_3_473
I agree!  Everything that surrounds Christmas makes me smile and feel content.  It makes me thankful for everything good in life!	hit:4980_conv:9961_4_277
Each day waking up I can't believe how lucky am I just to be alive.	hit:4986_conv:9972_1_60
That's a great outlook I think. We often lose focus of that very important fact.	hit:4986_conv:9972_2_332
Yes, I don't need anything. I have something to eat and a roof over my head. I really can't ask for anything more.	hit:4986_conv:9972_3_60
That's inspiring to me. I will try to think more like that as well whenever I get stressed in life.	hit:4986_conv:9972_4_332
I went running for the first time in months. I could not believe it. I was able to run a full 8 miles with out taking a break.	hit:4992_conv:9984_1_60
8 Miles!? That's very impressive.  I bet I could barely make it a mile!	hit:4992_conv:9984_2_448
Yes, my first time out in 60 days. I impressed my self.	hit:4992_conv:9984_3_60
Have you been a long time runner before that?	hit:4992_conv:9984_4_448
Not really. A few years ago I got tired of being fat so one day I just went out and started running. Two months ago I stopped due to hurting my back surfing. I got the all clear yesterday and went back out.	hit:4992_conv:9984_5_60
Just gave my wife access to my credit card. I'm worried but excited I can trust her. Do you ever have issues trusting people?	hit:4998_conv:9996_1_60
I can relate to that!  Yeah, my wife with my credit card, lol!	hit:4998_conv:9996_2_448
It's taken me 11 years to get to this point. Last time I let her have at it. She bought us a trip to mexico on my credit card.	hit:4998_conv:9996_3_60
Haha, I can understand the hesitation then.  But was the vacation at least worth the money?	hit:4998_conv:9996_4_448
It was fun. Adults only resort, all inclusive, private swimming pool off the room but cost 500 a day.	hit:4998_conv:9996_5_60

I'm glad you were able to have fun and be surrounded by those that love you.|Yes, it's great when you run into an old friend you haven't saw for a long time. |Oh goodness, I am so sorry to hear that. Was it sudden?|Aww, I know that can be hard, but you can't be too hard on yourself.  Sometimes you don't have a choice.|That sounds fun! Where did you go?|That sucks sorry to hear. Are you okay?|Oh, wow! That is crazy, have you talked to the vet?|How long had you been married ?|That's great. I bet it was wonderful experience.|That is a good thing then|You mean nostalgic?|Sorry to hear that my friend. Why did you move?|Oh my goodness, did you go to check what the noise was?|Oh that's so great!|You sound very confident. That's good|I am bad at every game.|Yes, I like your attitude. |That's a good idea! It's always smart to be on the safe side.|I am greatly looking towards starting a family with my wife as well. George is such a nice name.|What prompted his back flip?|I hope you would wear a belt next time.|Oh I'm so sorry to hear that. People are so inconsiderate!|Oh, that's a big one. I bet it caused a lot of damage|That is great of them, did you do anything to pay them back?|That sounds like quite the checklist. I'm glad you brought the beer you might need it haha!|That sucks! I hate wasps and most other bugs, so I feel your annoyance.|Exactly good luck|Yes, I can understand that.. Sometimes nothing compares.. Have you guys played recently?|I am sorry your dog passed away, I totally understand wanting to keep a momento to remind you of him. Was he old when he passed?|I agree, I eat what I want when I want all the time.|you are very welcome. good luck!|Wow, did they notice?|On no! Did you have to walk, or did you call for service?|Wow.

What a great feeling that is, to be appreciated and valued!|I am sorry to hear that, why did you move there?|Whoa that is really cool. Did you train him to do that?|I am so sorry to hear that. I'm sure she was very happy while she was alive with you guys.|Awww, well maybe you'll have grandchildren that you can take one day!|It's wonderful peace of mind to find someone you can trust with your fur babies! Did you have a nice trip?|Right, but I'd say once isn't too bad as long you stay on track.|Why did he do that?|I wish you luck|Yeah, flying can be scary.|ooops sorry to hear that|That's amazing! You must be so proud.|I feel your pain.  I live in Orlando, Florida.  So Im in the same boat.|Oh no!  Was he OK?  I hope it was nothing serious!|That's great , sorry for the error and unrelated message previously sent :) but you do have great friend that are dependable|Nice! I used to live in St. Paul, MN.  Weather's like a tundra which is why I'm down here|That is a good attitude. Better luck next time!|why don't you go get yourself some food? or just order some?|Did he get it back? I hate it when that happens...|Dang.. my old roommate was an engineering student. He always told me how hard it was. What kind of engineering?|When and how? Are you flying or driving? Just because or is it your anniversary?|That is exactly the way you are supposed to feel. Did you get the job?|and what does that mean practically? what will you do differently?|You can always show her the ways|Oh no! Do you think it's a wild animal?|I've actually haven't played that series. When does it come out?|I'm so sorry to hear that. How old is the cat?|Thats good. Everyone isnt so fortunate.|That's a profound thought. We definitely take America for granted, especially when some people say it's in its worst state in a long time."" We're prisoners of the moment.|Well that was nice. How long were you stuck there|That's the worst! Have you tried talking to your neighbor?|yea it can be sore and you cant eat anything|Well, it was worth $500! That's about what my car's worth these days - had it for years. Still runs great tho'.|An hour? Damn for somewhere as meh as Denny's that really isn't worth it.|I'm glad that it all worked out!|Ohhhh, disgusting.  What did you do?|You have a test coming up?|That unfortunate.  Are you feeling a little jealous?|You need to calm down and focus so that you can pass the exam|OH NO that is the worst! Did you clean it up?|That's something that takes a lot of contemplation, because it's such a big decision to make.

McD's all the way|Yeah, I am sure it will be fine|I am always scared about those airbags!  I am so glad you are ok!|Mmm, now you're making me hungry for cake. What kind of cake was it?|What are you planning on doing with it?|I get it. Sometimes I feel stressed out for no real reason myself.|Just spend what time you can with her, I'd like to say something really profound but aging parents is a situation that just sucks. Sorry you are having to deal with it.|Since you didn't hurt yourself I think I will have to laugh. It sounds like it was funny.|Oh wow, so he basically ghosted you? I would be mad too|yeeees. I am alos supporting France. I hope it wins|A puppy!  That's so exciting!  Are you going to keep it?|Aw man that sucks. It must have been a crazy storm.|Good luck on the exam! |What did she surprise you with?|well have you practiced interviewing? With that you can feel so much better!|Oh well that's great!

I'm glad you're proud of her, I'm sure she worked very hard for her success!|Have you tried to call her?|Come on, you do not have to be jealous of your brother|Wow!! That's crazy. I'm like that though. I never win anything either|That's good, glad he wasn't having too tough a time.|I'm so sorry to hear that.

An extra 40k a year but it would be highly stressful. Currently I have the highest ratings in the USA, I'm sure any new employer would want me to bring them up to that stage as well. 	hit:5003_conv:10007_3_60
Oh wow, an additional 40K is a lot! I'd be willing to put up with quite a bit for a pay increase that large.	hit:5003_conv:10007_4_286
I currently work 50 hours a week. I'd be working around 75-80 a week then.	hit:5003_conv:10007_5_60
Oh wow. I'll be honest and say it wouldn't be worth it for me! What's an extra 40K if you're never not at work to enjoy it?	hit:5003_conv:10007_6_286
I took my wife surfing for the first time today. within an hour she was riding waves, Color me impressed!	hit:5008_conv:10016_1_60
Oh wow, I think it'd take me much longer to not bust my butt! That is impressive!	hit:5008_conv:10016_2_286
Yes,  I was surprised. I've been at it my entire life and never seen anyone pick it up so quickly. She is not even athletic.	hit:5008_conv:10016_3_60

That's good on his part, how do you feel about it?	hit:5015_conv:10030_2_448
I thought it was amazing he got it, seemed like a tough job to land	hit:5015_conv:10030_3_111

Going to the doctor for the first time since 2001 tomorrow. I'm dreading telling the doctor how long it has been since my last visit. 	hit:5030_conv:10061_1_60
It will be okay. It's always hard making that step, but it's good for your health to do it.	hit:5030_conv:10061_2_366
I'm only going because my insurance gives me a gift card for going. I'm in perfect health. But still ashamed.	hit:5030_conv:10061_3_60
I wish my insurance would give me something like that! It's good to go anyways.	hit:5030_conv:10061_4_366

Hey everyone trips up a little. What you need to remember is that you and your wife made a commitment and you should follow through on that. 	hit:5037_conv:10074_2_478
Yea I know. The real issues is that I want to stop again from more tomorrow. 	hit:5037_conv:10074_3_60

I just turned in my dissertation. I'm scared it will not pass and all my work toward my masters will be for nothing.	hit:5043_conv:10087_1_60
You only get to do it once?	hit:5043_conv:10087_2_27
Yes, you turn it in then go in front of a board of people. In my case 10 people. If they don't like it I can't go one to work on my PhD and will need to write another. This one has taken 2 years to write.	hit:5043_conv:10087_3_60
Oh no. I hope it goes well for you. That's a lot of hard work.	hit:5043_conv:10087_4_27

The other day I was drinking and sent an email I shouldn't have. I felt so stupid when I woke up and realized what I'd done.	hit:5048_conv:10096_1_473
That has happened to me, but with texts though lol	hit:5048_conv:10096_2_27
Yeah I've done that, too. The funny thing is I'm usually pretty eloquent even when I'm drunk so I don't think the recipient even realized I was drunk when I wrote it.	hit:5048_conv:10096_3_473
Did you apologize?	hit:5048_conv:10096_4_27
No, when they responded I just played it off like I meant to send it. Everything turned out fine!	hit:5048_conv:10096_5_473

can you fix it?	hit:5049_conv:10099_4_463
Got on the scale today. I've only been on a diet 2 weeks and I'm down 17 pounds.	hit:5051_conv:10103_1_60
That is great news. Have you also been working out?	hit:5051_conv:10103_2_4
Not really. I average 10 miles a day walking at work but did that when I was fat as well. I cut out all processed foods and drinks.	hit:5051_conv:10103_3_60
Has it been easy or hard to do that?	hit:5051_conv:10103_4_4
Rough. I used to like Iced tea and now only drink black coffee or water. I miss flavor. Plus it's a lot of work cooking everything.	hit:5051_conv:10103_5_60
I took some candy a friend left out	hit:5053_conv:10106_1_111
did they notice it was missing?	hit:5053_conv:10106_2_514

The other day this creepy guy followed me around the store and chased me out to the parking lot. He just wouldn't take a hint.	hit:5057_conv:10115_1_473
That's very creepy, did he say anything to you?	hit:5057_conv:10115_2_448
Yeah that's what made it weird, it was kind of like he was trying to hit on me but just awkward. But he was really pushy about it.	hit:5057_conv:10115_3_473
Those are definitely the scary types, they don't recognize social cues at all.	hit:5057_conv:10115_4_448

Hopefully she will see a doctor soon about it	hit:5058_conv:10117_3_111
Oh good.  Hopefully she'll try to fix it with physical therapy first.  Some doctors love to do surgery right away when its not necessary.  Recommend that she get a second opinion.  Hope she resolves it!	hit:5058_conv:10117_4_438

Not entirely sure, I marked my lunch so they knew it wasn't theirs	hit:5061_conv:10122_3_111

What did you do?	hit:5061_conv:10123_2_111
I blocked her and sent her a long text explaining how angry and disappointed I was. I didn't know what else to do.	hit:5061_conv:10123_3_473
You definitely can't be too careful these days	hit:5061_conv:10123_4_111

how do you know no one goes in if you arent in there?	hit:5062_conv:10124_2_238
Because I work in the same little office alone all day. Today I did not use the bathroom no one came in. yesterday I went twice and each time I went I had someone waiting on me when I got back to my desk.	hit:5062_conv:10124_3_60

I discovered my cat peed on my bath mat when I got out of the shower today and the mat was wet.	hit:5073_conv:10147_1_473
Oh no! That stinks. I've never had a cat specifically because I've never been good with the idea of being able to train them. Plus it seems like you just get the one personality, and they never grow to like you. But I'm biased.	hit:5073_conv:10147_2_273
It's funny you say that, I actually like that about cats. They are independent and not too needy, which sort of describes me! I love my cats... the peeing on my bath mat aside.	hit:5073_conv:10147_3_473
Yeah, I know they definitely suit some people. I actually now technically have one... my roommate wanted to get one, and I felt too bad to say no. And he actually is a pretty nice guy, mostly because he's been affectionate from the start. So, we'll see how it goes! Sorry again about your mat.	hit:5073_conv:10147_4_273
Here's hoping your cat grows on you, they have a funny ability to do so.	hit:5073_conv:10147_5_473
I got the courage to contact a potential client the other day and set a rate for my work that's higher than I usually charge.	hit:5077_conv:10154_1_473
Wow good for you! I hope that it works out for you!	hit:5077_conv:10154_2_478
Thanks! The work isn't terribly exciting but it felt good not having to negotiate knowing the client wanted me to do work for them.	hit:5077_conv:10154_3_473
Yeah and I bet the higher paycheck will make the work worth it. 	hit:5077_conv:10154_4_478

That's great. Do they know?	hit:5082_conv:10165_2_27
They have no clue. They know I ask them to do more then others but are clueless. I'm excited for them and the also the stress load they will take off of me. 	hit:5082_conv:10165_3_60

Astrophysics	hit:5100_conv:10201_3_60
Oh geeze, I didn't know I was talking to a genius.  How long is the program?	hit:5100_conv:10201_4_294
I have another 3-4 years then I'll go into teaching.	hit:5100_conv:10201_5_60
I start my last year of my Masters program Friday. I'm scared I feel like I'm all ready behind.	hit:5112_conv:10224_1_60
Have you tried to talk to your teacher?	hit:5112_conv:10224_2_4
No it's mostly I feel behind on my thesis. When I started they told us keep up or drop out. I should have known, it's one of the hardest schools to get into.	hit:5112_conv:10224_3_60
What school is this you are talking about?	hit:5112_conv:10224_4_4
Cornell University, after this year I transfer to Princeton for my PhD	hit:5112_conv:10224_5_60
I spent all summer getting ready to write my thesis. I can't wait to get time to start.	hit:5124_conv:10248_1_60
That's pretty cool that you're motivated and excited to start it. Most people would be scared and procrastinating. You'll do great.	hit:5124_conv:10248_2_273
I need to get it over. I need to start paying back student loans. It's the last thing I need to do before I can get hired as a Ad Professor. 	hit:5124_conv:10248_3_60
Sounds like you have a plan laid out. It also sounds like you've already accomplished so much.. You should be very proud. I'm with you, I have over $40,000 in student loans. Such a crazy pressure on someone right when they graduate. Good luck!	hit:5124_conv:10248_4_273
I've been paying on mine and have 75 still to pay. Then I want a PhD so that will be another 50k	hit:5124_conv:10248_5_60
I love to be snuggled up with attention and time with my boyfriend when he doesn't I get sad and jealous. 	hit:5211_conv:10423_1_284
I can understand that.	hit:5211_conv:10423_2_322
I know he has to spend time with others but I get envious I want every minute spent together I'm spoiled lol.	hit:5211_conv:10423_3_284
You must love him very much, that's good.	hit:5211_conv:10423_4_322
I do best feeling ever.	hit:5211_conv:10423_5_284
I'm at a new school and I won't have any friends	hit:5291_conv:10582_1_509
Aw, it takes time! Making friends isn't always so easy so give it a little bit of time	hit:5291_conv:10582_2_234
Yes, but how do I even talk to people I don't know?	hit:5291_conv:10582_3_509
The best thing to do is join clubs and get involved. You generally make friends by association!	hit:5291_conv:10582_4_234
I felt very great a few weeks ago when i helped an elderly women bag her groceries	hit:5292_conv:10584_1_12
that is really nice of you to do, not a lot of people help others like that anymore	hit:5292_conv:10584_2_507
Yeah thats true most people don't.  I love helping those in need it's a great feeling	hit:5292_conv:10584_3_12
same with me if i ever see someone that could use my help, i will most likely bring it to you	hit:5292_conv:10584_4_507
I can't believe I didn't get that promotion at work :(	hit:5300_conv:10601_1_509
Ah dang... Sorry that happened to you. It stinks too because a lot of the time that stuff is just decided by who is liked more, or who has better connections, and not actual merit. If you're good, I'm sure you will get recognized at some point.	hit:5300_conv:10601_2_273
Agreed, it's a popularity contest!	hit:5300_conv:10601_3_509
Well, keep a good attitude. If you like the work and the job, hopefully that will be enough.	hit:5300_conv:10601_4_273
My wife cheated on me! It's absurd!!	hit:5301_conv:10602_1_509
Thats very sad to hear im sorry that happened to you 	hit:5301_conv:10602_2_12
Thank you, what should I do about it?	hit:5301_conv:10602_3_509
I would suggest moving on time heals all wounds	hit:5301_conv:10602_4_12
I was very happy last week helping an elderly women bag her groceries 	hit:5301_conv:10603_1_12
Did she say thank you?	hit:5301_conv:10603_2_509
Yes she did thank me 	hit:5301_conv:10603_3_12
What a lovely woman, and you're lovely, too!	hit:5301_conv:10603_4_509
Ugh, my neighbor's dogs wouldn't stop barking this morning!	hit:5303_conv:10606_1_503
That's the worst! What did you do?	hit:5303_conv:10606_2_509
Well I'll tell you what I didn't do. I didn't go back to sleep, due to the noise. I think I'm going to have a word with him later.	hit:5303_conv:10606_3_503
That sounds like a good idea. I hope you solve the problem quickly!	hit:5303_conv:10606_4_509
Remember when we were young and could run through the fields of flowers? I miss it.	hit:5303_conv:10607_1_509
Yeah, those were better times. Brings back good memories.	hit:5303_conv:10607_2_503
Maybe we can relive such times through our children.	hit:5303_conv:10607_3_509
Well, maybe yours. Mine just want to sit inside and play on their phones all day.	hit:5303_conv:10607_4_503
I don't understand why people come to work to just not do their jobs I have a coworker like this.	hit:5304_conv:10608_1_284
Oh man..I have had those too..and where I am the one getting crap even though I do my job and everyone elses..I HATE sitting around at work...I either want to work or go home. I hope your boss knows your co-worker is lazy?	hit:5304_conv:10608_2_296
We are on the same page I have to pick up their slack and it just irritates me to the upmost it's like just quit please or give me a raise for doing double work. 	hit:5304_conv:10608_3_284
I AGREE and frankly if your boss does not see this and doesn't give you praise then I would quit as well or contact human resources! This kind of stuff is not acceptable.	hit:5304_conv:10608_4_296
The desert was incredible! The taste! The look! The feel as I ate it!	hit:5305_conv:10610_1_509
sounds like you ate a delicious dessert, what did you eat?	hit:5305_conv:10610_2_507
It was chocolate ice cream dipped in crushed cookies, marshmallows, and chocolate sauce which had frozen to a crisp!	hit:5305_conv:10610_3_509
that sounds delicious i love chocolate cake i think that would be my favorite dessert	hit:5305_conv:10610_4_507
I think I'm going to move my mother into my house with us.	hit:5306_conv:10613_1_503
O? That's a brave and noble decision.	hit:5306_conv:10613_2_278
Yeah, she's been pretty sick lately. I want to make sure she's here where she can get all of the care that she needs.	hit:5306_conv:10613_3_503
That's hard but great of you to do, good luck.	hit:5306_conv:10613_4_278
I'm going shopping tomorrow, it'll be so much fun!	hit:5307_conv:10615_1_509
Where will you be shopping?	hit:5307_conv:10615_2_537
I think I'll go to Costco and Walmart.	hit:5307_conv:10615_3_509
Nice! Do you have anything in specific you want to buy?	hit:5307_conv:10615_4_537
I'm so sad, my avocado was moldy this morning!	hit:5310_conv:10621_1_509
hahah it whas happened to me it the worst thing	hit:5310_conv:10621_2_507
It really is! :(	hit:5310_conv:10621_3_509
did you still eat it? or did you throw it away	hit:5310_conv:10621_4_507
My family is the best they through me a surprise birthday party.	hit:5312_conv:10625_1_284
That's nice of them! People stopped doing that for me once I got older. I miss them	hit:5312_conv:10625_2_234
I was amazed they even did that but very grateful I haven't had anything in a while also so you wasn't alone your family will do something and you will enjoy it. 	hit:5312_conv:10625_3_284
Well, I'm happy for you :) It shows that they care	hit:5312_conv:10625_4_234
i was shocked when i found out my wife cheated on me	hit:5313_conv:10626_1_12
Thats horrible! Im so sorry to hear that.  Why would she do that?	hit:5313_conv:10626_2_301
Im not sure what should i do though ?	hit:5313_conv:10626_3_12
It depends, if you love her, you could try to work it out.  Or you could cheat on her too	hit:5313_conv:10626_4_301
My friend taught his dog some tricks. It's really fun to watch!	hit:5317_conv:10635_1_503
O yea? I	hit:5317_conv:10635_2_278
It's amazing how quickly the dog responds to the commands. My friend must really know what he's doing.	hit:5317_conv:10635_3_503
I'm trying to teach mine tricks myself* I think that's fun to watch!	hit:5317_conv:10635_4_278
I was taking an important test in one of my classes the other day... I'm ashamed to say that I cheated.	hit:5320_conv:10641_1_503
I've cheated on occasion. It's never right but it's easy. At least you're ashamed of it.	hit:5320_conv:10641_2_538
Yeah... I'm thinking about coming clean about it to my professor before he finds out on his own.	hit:5320_conv:10641_3_503
That's your decision to make, but I think it would at least put you in control of the situation.	hit:5320_conv:10641_4_538
My wife and I are going out to one of my favorite restaurants tonight.	hit:5322_conv:10644_1_503
That sounds fun. Is it a special occasion?	hit:5322_conv:10644_2_422
Not really, just felt like going out. I'm thinking about ordering something I haven't had before, but.... I don't know. I'm weird about trying new foods.	hit:5322_conv:10644_3_503
I understand. Sticking with what you know seems safer.	hit:5322_conv:10644_4_422
I bought a used car a couple months ago and I have to say it's holding up really well for a 6 year old car. It's like new.	hit:5330_conv:10661_1_475
you must be loving it	hit:5330_conv:10661_2_43
I am, You never know what shape a used car really is until you have it for a while.	hit:5330_conv:10661_3_475
true that, you cant be too sure until you use it	hit:5330_conv:10661_4_43
I have a performance review coming up at work in a couple of weeks.	hit:5331_conv:10663_1_503
Tough week ahead. Do you think you have met your expectations thus far?	hit:5331_conv:10663_2_155
Oh yeah. I'm pretty sure the review is going to go well. I might even get a raise!	hit:5331_conv:10663_3_503
Sounds good. Your supervisor must proud of your work and your displayed high self-esteem	hit:5331_conv:10663_4_155
I just got notice that my mortgage payment has gone up this year and i'm so mad about it.	hit:5336_conv:10672_1_475
Oh no! That has so happened to me before! It was only by a couple dollars a month but I SO needed those couple of dollars at the time. I would be MAAADDD	hit:5336_conv:10672_2_227
I am, it went up 20 dollars. 	hit:5336_conv:10672_3_475
Call the bank and get it fixed ASAP! That's got to be so annoying for you!	hit:5336_conv:10672_4_227
I have to go over the paperwork, it may be because my insurance went up.	hit:5336_conv:10672_5_475
I don't play the lottery, ever, but a friend recently gave me a scratch off ticket.	hit:5347_conv:10694_1_339
I buy those like twice a year and never win.	hit:5347_conv:10694_2_53
I won $200!	hit:5347_conv:10694_3_339
Wow! That's awesome! What did you do with it?	hit:5347_conv:10694_4_53
I blew it on online video games, lol.	hit:5347_conv:10694_5_339
Hey, why not? It's unexpected money!	hit:5347_conv:10694_6_53
That is always the best kind.  I still won't be buying lottery tickets, lol.	hit:5347_conv:10694_7_339
Yeah I feel like you get lucky once then it's all downhill from there.	hit:5347_conv:10694_8_53
My girlfriend and I were at a party Friday night. I couldn't find her anywhere, and got worried.	hit:5356_conv:10712_1_339
Where was she?	hit:5356_conv:10712_2_225
In a spare bedroom with her ex, laying on the bed and kissing him.	hit:5356_conv:10712_3_339
Does she have a new ex now?	hit:5356_conv:10712_4_225
Worked out for the best, she was honestly a pain anyways.	hit:5356_conv:10712_5_339
She sure does. I am not putting up with that, lol.	hit:5358_conv:10716_1_339
I would not put up with it either 	hit:5358_conv:10716_2_321
I love the rain.  It makes everything feel fresh.	hit:5358_conv:10716_3_339
i love when the rain his the soil in the open field , the smell of wet dirt is just refreshing	hit:5358_conv:10716_4_321
I agree.  It hasn't rained here in weeks.  I miss the raing.	hit:5358_conv:10716_5_339
im stoked to go to the park later today	hit:5378_conv:10756_1_44

sounds like a real good time i hope you enjoy it 	hit:5378_conv:10756_4_11
i felt bad about sleeping in today	hit:5388_conv:10776_1_44
Why is that 	hit:5388_conv:10776_2_237
i fell behind on things i needed to get done	hit:5388_conv:10776_3_44
You will be alright buddy	hit:5388_conv:10776_4_237
i feel like a have accomplished a lot this summer	hit:5391_conv:10783_1_44
What have you done this year if you dont mind me asking?	hit:5391_conv:10783_2_506
ive gotten a lot of work done and spent time with friends and family	hit:5391_conv:10783_3_44
That is great, well there is still time to go this year!	hit:5391_conv:10783_4_506
i am happy about the beautiful weather today	hit:5395_conv:10791_1_44
I love it when it's nice out. Are you going to do something outside?	hit:5395_conv:10791_2_542
yes, im going to the park later this afternoon!	hit:5395_conv:10791_3_44
That sounds great. A nice long walk in perfect weather. There's hardly anything better.	hit:5395_conv:10791_4_542
My brother just bought a new car...	hit:5396_conv:10793_1_503
Are you excited for him or jealous? lol 	hit:5396_conv:10793_2_11
Well, I can't help but feel like he only did it to make me feel inferior.	hit:5396_conv:10793_3_503
I feel you! I know its hard having siblings sometimes! Go buy a toy car and park it on top of his. 	hit:5396_conv:10793_4_11
I got a threatening phone call... and now I'm scared.	hit:5406_conv:10813_1_503
Can you report the caller?	hit:5406_conv:10813_2_506
I should be able to. I recognized the voice, it's someone that I used to know.	hit:5406_conv:10813_3_503
Be sure to do it, otherwise they could keep harassing you	hit:5406_conv:10813_4_506

What class is it for?	hit:5412_conv:10824_2_538

i am thankful for my supportive family	hit:5416_conv:10833_1_44
That's great.  Have they always been as supportive as they are now	hit:5416_conv:10833_2_119
yes i have been very fortunate	hit:5416_conv:10833_3_44
nice.  what do you do for a living	hit:5416_conv:10833_4_119
I went out to the garden and there were a ton of mosquitoes, I couldn't even do any gardening.	hit:5417_conv:10835_1_475
Have you thought about spraying your garden?	hit:5417_conv:10835_2_506
I thought about it but they were coming from the grass around it and I'm worried the dog would get sick if I sprayed the grass	hit:5417_conv:10835_3_475
Perhaps there is an all natural remedy you could try	hit:5417_conv:10835_4_506
Hopefully. there were so many I thought I was in a jungle.	hit:5417_conv:10835_5_475
i was shocked how nice the weather has been the past couple days	hit:5422_conv:10844_1_44
Same here, I'm in Texas.  Where are you located	hit:5422_conv:10844_2_119
in the midwest!	hit:5422_conv:10844_3_44
Nice! I used to live in St. Paul, MN.  Weather's like a tundra which is why I'm down here	hit:5422_conv:10844_4_119
I was mowing the lawn today and it started storming out of nowhere!	hit:5423_conv:10846_1_475
Were you able to get inside fast?	hit:5423_conv:10846_2_243
No. I was in the middle of the yard and it was sunny, next thing I know it's pouring down rain and I'm soaked.	hit:5423_conv:10846_3_475
Oh wow! That would be annoying!	hit:5423_conv:10846_4_243
im envious of my friends who are off work today	hit:5457_conv:10914_1_44
How did they get off work midweek?	hit:5457_conv:10914_2_26
thats just their normal schedule	hit:5457_conv:10914_3_44
That would be nice but not fun that you don't have the same days off.	hit:5457_conv:10914_4_26
We go on vacation once a year as a family.	hit:5457_conv:10915_1_26
where is your favorite place to go?	hit:5457_conv:10915_2_44
I just love going, when it gets closer to when we are leaving I look forward to it.	hit:5457_conv:10915_3_26
i can imagine, i hope you have a great time this year	hit:5457_conv:10915_4_44
My son starts kindergarten soon. He is my first one.	hit:5459_conv:10919_1_26
I remember when my first child started, I was a nervous wreck.	hit:5459_conv:10919_2_286
They sent out an email saying that he may end up with a substitute teacher until they hire someone. 	hit:5459_conv:10919_3_26
So they don't even have teachers yet? Wow, that's crazy.	hit:5459_conv:10919_4_286
It is! And we are paying for the school, I'm not to happy.	hit:5459_conv:10919_5_26
I have no friends and I am lonely	hit:5470_conv:10941_1_547
Have you tried getting out and meeting new people?	hit:5470_conv:10941_2_220
No, it is difficult to meet people in my area because I like in a farm. I only talk to the animals	hit:5470_conv:10941_3_547
What about online friends?	hit:5470_conv:10941_4_220
Can you be my online friend?	hit:5470_conv:10941_5_547
My friends went to dinner without me	hit:5485_conv:10970_1_111
that would hurt my feelings. are you alright?	hit:5485_conv:10970_2_463
I'm fine, just disappointed mostly	hit:5485_conv:10970_3_111
i totally understand that. i'm sorry.	hit:5485_conv:10970_4_463
I woke up and my car had a flat tire	hit:5489_conv:10978_1_111
That sucks! Did you have a spare on you?	hit:5489_conv:10978_2_537
No, but I was able to get it towed easily enough	hit:5489_conv:10978_3_111
That is good to hear.	hit:5489_conv:10978_4_537
A co-worker was having issues finishing a project	hit:5514_conv:11029_1_111
That's understandable. What kind of project was it? Were you involved?	hit:5514_conv:11029_2_117
It was a major work project, I stepped in to help him	hit:5514_conv:11029_3_111
That's so generous of you. It's people like you that make the work week bearable!	hit:5514_conv:11029_4_117
I was really apprehensive about going to university at the age of 30.	hit:5546_conv:11092_1_549
That's okay, I'm 25 and still in college. How did it go for you? 	hit:5546_conv:11092_2_392
It went pretty well! I got great grades and made friends despite the age difference.	hit:5546_conv:11092_3_549
That's awesome. I'm glad it worked out well for you. :)	hit:5546_conv:11092_4_392
Thank you! In the end I had no reason to worry about it.	hit:5546_conv:11092_5_549
Once I was stranded hours from home in a snowstorm. I ended up going to a stranger's house to wait it out	hit:5551_conv:11102_1_549
Oh wow. I would have been so scared. more of a stranger than the storm	hit:5551_conv:11102_2_27
Well, she was really nice and we had been waiting together in the snow for awhile, so I felt I could trust her.	hit:5551_conv:11102_3_549
Well that was nice. How long were you stuck there	hit:5551_conv:11102_4_27
I was looking at advertisements of my childhood toys recently and felt strangely overwhelmed with emotion.	hit:5558_conv:11117_1_549
Did the ads bring up good memories I hope?	hit:5558_conv:11117_2_525
Yes! Especially the ads for toys I haven't thought of in years, like Boglins.	hit:5558_conv:11117_3_549
I have absolutely no idea what Boglins are, but I'm sure they were awesome!	hit:5558_conv:11117_4_525
Once when I was a kid I got caught in a riptide with my sister. It was very scary!	hit:5562_conv:11124_1_549
Sounds frightening! Was this off the coast of a beach or something?	hit:5562_conv:11124_2_466
Yes, Martinique Beach in Nova Scotia. The currents are very strong.	hit:5562_conv:11124_3_549
That is one of my greatest fears. Did you have to swim sideways from the current to escape?	hit:5562_conv:11124_4_466
Yes that's right! I was a strong swimmer so we made it.	hit:5562_conv:11124_5_549
Great to hear that you made it out ok!	hit:5562_conv:11124_6_466
I suppose to be on a committed diet but I kind of cheated today.	hit:5567_conv:11134_1_284
Well, I can understand that. It's very hard to be on a very strict diet, without a break here and now!	hit:5567_conv:11134_2_45
It is my coworkers said they was going to Burger King and I couldn't resist I feel so bad and guilty.	hit:5567_conv:11134_3_284
Well, i am sure you are disappointed, but all you can do now is just get back on the diet again and try to be more dedicated. It's hard, I know!	hit:5567_conv:11134_4_45

Yea, a new job is useless pretty stressful.	hit:5587_conv:11175_2_278
I would say I was more nervous then anything I think the new setting was over whelming but a month later I feel a lot better now. 	hit:5587_conv:11175_3_284
It will be ok in the end.	hit:5587_conv:11175_4_278
I had a car accident the other day!	hit:5674_conv:11349_1_482
Oh that is a real bummer. Were you hurt?	hit:5674_conv:11349_2_139
Yeah it was! No luckily nobody got hurt thanks. The worst part was actually having to talk to the insurance company	hit:5674_conv:11349_3_482
Ok glad you did not get injured. I hope your car gets fixed.	hit:5674_conv:11349_4_139

That must of been fun to go through.	hit:5749_conv:11499_2_4
It was brilliant.  My mum must have gathered it up over the years.  I spent hours going through it all.  it made me feel so nostalgic.  I think its a great idea though, I might start doing it for my kids.	hit:5749_conv:11499_3_208
That is cool. Is your mother still alive?	hit:5749_conv:11499_4_4
No sadly so i didnt even know it was there.  Was definitely a wonderful surprise to find it.	hit:5749_conv:11499_5_208
Man that was hard to deal with today.	hit:5770_conv:11540_1_132
What was?	hit:5770_conv:11540_2_196
I had a lull in work and the store was empty, and there was nobody in there for an hour.  I was about to go insane.	hit:5770_conv:11540_3_132
Really? Did you manage to cope?	hit:5770_conv:11540_4_196
First it was just boring then I started to actually get pretty lonely.  I saw if there was something I could read while I waited.	hit:5770_conv:11540_5_132
And was there?	hit:5770_conv:11540_6_196
Yeah there was a magazine or two.  I got by	hit:5770_conv:11540_7_132

You know I have a friend that has a very successful business that he started with only a few thousand dollars	hit:5787_conv:11575_1_411
Really, how did they do it?	hit:5787_conv:11575_2_196
They started an irrigation sprinkler business with just a few contracts and its blown up and now he's handling large companies	hit:5787_conv:11575_3_411
Amazing! Well done to him.	hit:5787_conv:11575_4_196

Exactly. It was so dang hot today, too.	hit:5789_conv:11579_3_549
Heat wave is getting so terrible theses days. I even watched on CNN that the whole of New South Wales is experiencing a drought, so sad	hit:5789_conv:11579_4_237
I kept getting stuck behind an irritating man while grocery shopping yesterday. He was so loud and always in my aisle.	hit:5793_conv:11587_1_549
That sounds unfortunate. You must have been so annoyed with him!	hit:5793_conv:11587_2_59
I was! He had an uncanny knack of blocking me and taking up the whole width of the aisle.	hit:5793_conv:11587_3_549
People like that should just do shopping online instead of ruining the experience for everyone else!	hit:5793_conv:11587_4_59
When I see little homeless girls I feel like a father.	hit:5801_conv:11603_1_326

Yes, the dog turned out to be fine, kid said he was training he her to be stronger.	hit:5809_conv:11619_3_326
Maybe someone should train the kid to be stronger... by beating him up!	hit:5809_conv:11619_4_377
Sometimes I feel like I am really an alright person.	hit:5811_conv:11623_1_326
What I do is to write all the good things I did within the week, I think you should do the same	hit:5811_conv:11623_2_237

i agree with you buddy	hit:5811_conv:11623_4_237

He sounds pretty strong. Any reason in particular that he did that?	hit:5880_conv:11761_2_466
My guess would be because he was drunk. It was still quite the sight to see.	hit:5880_conv:11761_3_340

I usually get out after finishing work to feel less lonely.	hit:5910_conv:11820_4_7
Once on my way to work I slipped and fell after I got off the bus and everyone stared at me. I laid there until the bus drove away because I felt so humiliated.	hit:5911_conv:11823_1_549

Yes he did. He knew that the other guy had been at a different job site, I will still not very happy about the situation.	hit:5918_conv:11837_3_340
I wouldn't be either. Are you going to try to talk to your coworker about it?	hit:5918_conv:11837_4_220

Good thinking. I'm sure the parent bunnies appreciated that.	hit:5966_conv:11933_4_422

It's been hard though, I've had many girls interested in me lately	hit:6252_conv:12505_3_111
Lol- Well poor you. I have always had guys doing the same and it means nothing to me. If I am in a relationship..or heck even when I am not..I don't get interested in random people generally. I have to know who someone is..Remember that- what lasts is WHO someone is...Someone you want to grow old with..Bodies won't last.	hit:6252_conv:12505_4_296

I hope so,i  got a little discouraged.But i will keep working out	hit:6427_conv:12854_3_6
Yes, don't let that stop you. Also pay attention to what you eat as well. It's even more important than the exercise portion.	hit:6427_conv:12854_4_332
I've been feeling pretty wholesome recently. 	hit:6430_conv:12860_1_326
I don't know whether that's a good or bad thing. Which is it?	hit:6430_conv:12860_2_566
It's good, I just meant that I can be by myself and feel alright.	hit:6430_conv:12860_3_326
That's great! It's definitely a good thing when you can be yourself.	hit:6430_conv:12860_4_566
About a week ago on the way home I smelt something so bad that it made me anxious.	hit:6431_conv:12862_1_326

Let's put it that way, even when it's harder I still remain positive.	hit:6432_conv:12865_3_326
I like that, how long have you felt this way about life?	hit:6432_conv:12865_4_323

What exactly did he do>	hit:6433_conv:12867_2_326
he tried to take my Driving licence by force on over speeding claims which was not true	hit:6433_conv:12867_3_178
Yes, some people have to stay away form law enforcement jobs.	hit:6433_conv:12867_4_326

Yeah, that's the problem. On weekends he likes to start hammering and sawing at 5am.	hit:6437_conv:12875_3_340
I see how that can be annoying, have you asked him to stop doing that?	hit:6437_conv:12875_4_516
The day that I got accepted into nursing school was just an ordinary day. 	hit:6438_conv:12877_1_567
You weren't excited about it?	hit:6438_conv:12877_2_188
Well I had been waiting for weeks and was unaware, but at the end of a stressful day I checked my mail and the letter came in to let me know if I got in or not. 	hit:6438_conv:12877_3_567
I understand. Stress is a definite mood killer	hit:6438_conv:12877_4_188

Oh no! Did you get the surgery?	hit:6472_conv:12944_2_196
I did and what an experience. I was alone in the hospital getting prepped for a major surgery not knowing if I was going to make it. 	hit:6472_conv:12944_3_567
But you have recovered now. Right?	hit:6472_conv:12944_4_196
Yea everthing is going well, but it still sends chills down my spine	hit:6472_conv:12944_5_567

I walked into the room while she was cooking and was very quiet. I felt bad about what I did. 	hit:6483_conv:12967_1_567
What did you do?	hit:6483_conv:12967_2_196
Well I went out with old college buds and got trashed and slept with another woman. 	hit:6483_conv:12967_3_567
Man! That's pretty bad.	hit:6483_conv:12967_4_196

A man recently tried to break into our house late at night.	hit:6551_conv:13102_1_339
oh wow. that is some scary stuff!! what happend?	hit:6551_conv:13102_2_514
It was about 3am. He was kicking our front door repeatedly.  My kids and wife were terrified as we waited for the cops to come.	hit:6551_conv:13102_3_339
did they catch the person?	hit:6551_conv:13102_4_514
They found him down the block, kicking at another house's door.  He was arrested, I believe.	hit:6551_conv:13102_5_339
i feel guilty for lying to mom that i had passed my exams	hit:6554_conv:13109_1_178
You shouldn't like to your mom. I think you should tell her the truth about what really happened.	hit:6554_conv:13109_2_217
yah, i will tell her when she comes back from work	hit:6554_conv:13109_3_178
That sounds like a great idea!	hit:6554_conv:13109_4_217
I felt very unpleasant last week when i fell to the ground skateboarding and lots of people saw it happen	hit:6559_conv:13119_1_12
Oh no! You have to have a tough mentality when you do that as it can be rough to have people see you fail	hit:6559_conv:13119_2_234
Yeah it was bad but i kept practicing and eventually learned pretty quick	hit:6559_conv:13119_3_12
That's good! Practice makes perfect and if everyone stopped when they failed, we would not have as much as we do today	hit:6559_conv:13119_4_234
Last week at work a coworker tried to take credit for a job that I had completed.	hit:6561_conv:13122_1_340
That's terrible. Did you let others know that you had completed the job?	hit:6561_conv:13122_2_566
I talked to my boss and get it all straightened out, but it was still a really crazy situation.	hit:6561_conv:13122_3_340
I could imagine. Some people stoop low to take credit for what others do.	hit:6561_conv:13122_4_566
I recently had surgery and needed help around the house and my best friend volunteered to help me. 	hit:6576_conv:13153_1_284

No she got me with those eyes but I was very irate with her for a few days and she knew it.	hit:6579_conv:13159_3_284
I'd be angry too, but it's hard to get mad at doggos.	hit:6579_conv:13159_4_288
It is they are loving she didn't mean to I bet lol.	hit:6579_conv:13159_5_284

That is awesome, what is his secret?	hit:6591_conv:13182_2_506
He worked 2 jobs and prior to starting he saved money I'm very influenced by his method I'm going to give it a try so I can be debt free as well.	hit:6591_conv:13182_3_284
Being debt free can be a great feeling	hit:6591_conv:13182_4_506
Last year my wife got laid off from her job.	hit:6596_conv:13193_1_340
Im sorry to hear that. Does she have a job now?	hit:6596_conv:13193_2_317
At the time it happened, my boss found out about it and gave me more hours to make up for our loss of income till she got another job.	hit:6596_conv:13193_3_340
Well that was nice of your boss. Its great to have good people in this world	hit:6596_conv:13193_4_317

You will get it happy thoughts only and if not something better is in store. 	hit:6598_conv:13196_4_284
I love to help my daughter with her school work and exams.	hit:6598_conv:13197_1_284
It sounds like you are a great parent.  Does she appreciate all the help you give?	hit:6598_conv:13197_2_318
Thank you and yes she does the memories together just pleases me so much I cherish these moments.	hit:6598_conv:13197_3_284

After being married for 8 years to my first wife, I found out she was having an affair behind my back.	hit:6599_conv:13198_1_340
Im sorry about that. How did you find out?	hit:6599_conv:13198_2_317
She came out and told me about it. It was one of the worst times in my life.	hit:6599_conv:13198_3_340
That stinks. Are you still with her or did you leave her?	hit:6599_conv:13198_4_317
My dog just learned how to ring the bell on the doorknob when he needs to go out	hit:6604_conv:13209_1_475
Whoa that is really cool. Did you train him to do that?	hit:6604_conv:13209_2_297
I put the bell on the door so it would ring when it opened and he got used to that, so now he associates the sound with having to go out. 	hit:6604_conv:13209_3_475
That is amazing. Must be a very smart dog.	hit:6604_conv:13209_4_297
I canceled a dinner with a old friend because I was just so tired had a long work week. 	hit:6609_conv:13219_1_284
I understand! As we get older, it's hard to do it all everyday!	hit:6609_conv:13219_2_296
It is I just feel a little guilt-ridden because I told her I had an emergency instead of telling her the truth because she would have tried to talk me into still coming out.	hit:6609_conv:13219_3_284
It happens, but definitely be honest as you would want someone to be honest with you	hit:6609_conv:13219_4_296
Last month my car threw a rod and needed to have the engine overhauled, leaving me without a way to get to work and back.	hit:6611_conv:13223_1_340
Oh no, are you able to afford the repair for it?	hit:6611_conv:13223_2_506
Well, a friend of mine let me borrow his car for a entire month while mine was repaired. He just tossed me the keys and said bring it back when your done.	hit:6611_conv:13223_3_340
What a great friend you have. Definitly get him a gift when you are done.	hit:6611_conv:13223_4_506

I'm about half way there. I want to save enough to rent a cottage on one of the lakes up there so I still have a ways to go.	hit:6637_conv:13275_3_475
That's great! I have faith that you can do it.	hit:6637_conv:13275_4_317
Thank you. I hope i reach my goal.	hit:6637_conv:13275_5_475
I paid off my credit card before buying my house.  I didnt realize how expensive owning would be and after some repairs I owe more than I started with on my card.	hit:6655_conv:13311_1_318
That's really good! Do you think you're ever going to use the card again?	hit:6655_conv:13311_2_209
Im hoping I wont have to.  Unless something major comes up I'm not planning on putting anything on credit again.	hit:6655_conv:13311_3_318
That is wise. I too am trying to pay off my credit card debts. After that, I'm cutting them up.	hit:6655_conv:13311_4_209
I was with some friends and went up to my room.  It was late at night and the lights were off.  When I left my room a bat flew at me and landed on my leg.	hit:6657_conv:13314_1_318
That would have really scared me.	hit:6657_conv:13314_2_297
It did scare me.  I let out a scream.  One of my friends went to school for wildlife.  He captured the bat and let it outside which was great.	hit:6657_conv:13314_3_318
I bet you are thankful that your friend was there.	hit:6657_conv:13314_4_297
I brought home a cake for my family, but I ate all of it! Ugh.	hit:6659_conv:13318_1_509
All of it??? Oh no. How bad do you feel right now?	hit:6659_conv:13318_2_297
Uhm, I feel awesome in my tummy, but bad in my heart LOL	hit:6659_conv:13318_3_509
Haha I bet. Im sure they were looking forward to it.	hit:6659_conv:13318_4_297
My roommate was very forgetful.  He would sometimes leave his dogs poop bags inside instead of bringing them out to the garage.	hit:6660_conv:13320_1_318
ewww.	hit:6660_conv:13320_2_262
It was gross.  All of a sudden you would smell something and then notice the bag sitting there.	hit:6660_conv:13320_3_318
Why would it be in the house to begin with? does the dog poop in the house?	hit:6660_conv:13320_4_262
I was watching TV and saw people with a happy family. It breaks my heart.	hit:6661_conv:13323_1_509
You are having trouble with family ?	hit:6661_conv:13323_2_225
My family isn't close, it's depressing.	hit:6661_conv:13323_3_509
Mine isn't either. Are you married?	hit:6661_conv:13323_4_225
I'm so hyped, I'm going to the movies!	hit:6664_conv:13328_1_509
Awesome! What are you going to see?	hit:6664_conv:13328_2_466
Not sure yet, I'll have to ask my friends	hit:6664_conv:13328_3_509
Whatever it is, I hope you have a good time!	hit:6664_conv:13328_4_466
I broke my leg, it's so upsetting.	hit:6665_conv:13330_1_509
Oh no!  How'd you do that?	hit:6665_conv:13330_2_305
I fell off a roof!	hit:6665_conv:13330_3_509
What were you doing on the roof?	hit:6665_conv:13330_4_305
We decided to go fishing last week.	hit:6665_conv:13331_1_305
Did you catch anything?	hit:6665_conv:13331_2_509
No!  And I was so confident that we would!	hit:6665_conv:13331_3_305
Did you at least have fun?	hit:6665_conv:13331_4_509
We did!  And some of the research work that we did let us experiment more than normal.	hit:6665_conv:13331_5_305

My daughter is only in eigth grade we have a while to go	hit:6669_conv:13338_4_262
I believed my father wouldn't let me down.	hit:6670_conv:13340_1_509
That is good to feel that way. You don't want to feel like someone close to you would let you down. Did it work out for you?	hit:6670_conv:13340_2_409
No, he totally bailed on me, as usual.	hit:6670_conv:13340_3_509
Oh I am sorry. That is sad. Remember that it is not your fault. I would think of the people who have been there for you. 	hit:6670_conv:13340_4_409
I'm about to move and I'm terrified! What if it has bugs? Or mold? Or something else I don't know about?	hit:6672_conv:13344_1_509
Oh gosh, you also scared of bugs?? That's my worst fear	hit:6672_conv:13344_2_50
Yes! I can't imagine them crawling on me when I sleep :/	hit:6672_conv:13344_3_509
I would have a heart attack! 	hit:6672_conv:13344_4_50
I remember eating my Baba's pierogies as a child, so yummy.	hit:6673_conv:13347_1_509
I have no idea what those are!	hit:6673_conv:13347_2_262
They are ukrainian pasta, kind of like stuffed pasta.	hit:6673_conv:13347_3_509
oh ok. I like ravioli is it like that?	hit:6673_conv:13347_4_262
I am so sad I have no pierogies.	hit:6675_conv:13351_1_509
What are pierogies? a type of food?	hit:6675_conv:13351_2_448
They are Ukrainian dumplings.	hit:6675_conv:13351_3_509
Ah nice, I love dumplings, what are in them?	hit:6675_conv:13351_4_448
The milk I drank this mornign went bad!	hit:6677_conv:13355_1_509
That's no good, did you throw it out?	hit:6677_conv:13355_2_448
Yes, but not before I drank some. :/	hit:6677_conv:13355_3_509
Hope you don't get sick!  That would be a bad start to the weekend.	hit:6677_conv:13355_4_448
I once had a fluffy cat named Leo, but he got lymphoma and I had to have him put to sleep.	hit:6682_conv:13365_1_573
Oh, I am so sorry. It has to be the most difficult thing to have to do. I had to do that with my gorgeous lab - I still miss him!	hit:6682_conv:13365_2_343
I'm sorry to hear about your lab as well. They are very sweet dogs.	hit:6682_conv:13365_3_573
Indeed they are. And so are many cats - the farm I used to live on has a ginger tom. He's quite the character and used to visit me regularly!	hit:6682_conv:13365_4_343
I love ginger cats! Leo was a ginger, and I have one right now named Chunk.	hit:6682_conv:13365_5_573
This fella is called Oliver. He's a big old softie who is ace at catching gophers. He would bring half eaten ones to my door!	hit:6682_conv:13365_6_343
Yikes! That doesn't sound pleasant, but I know they do that to try to show you they like you. They think you appreciate the gifts.	hit:6682_conv:13365_7_573
Oh, I shouldn't be ungrateful, lol! At least he kills them before delivering them. A friends cat used to deliver live mice into the bathtub!	hit:6682_conv:13365_8_343
I was so happy!  I have been working so hard for this company since I started so this is a great sign in my opinion!  	hit:6683_conv:13366_1_97
Did you get a promotion?	hit:6683_conv:13366_2_509
Not yet but I did get a raise!  If the company takes over I will get to be in charge of the helpdesk though!	hit:6683_conv:13366_3_97
Wow, great job!	hit:6683_conv:13366_4_509
Thank you! It's insane up here sometimes but I feel like I could be a good team lead.	hit:6683_conv:13366_5_97
I'm really scared to go back to school.	hit:6683_conv:13367_1_509
Oh no!  What has you scared?	hit:6683_conv:13367_2_97
It's all new to me, I've never done it before	hit:6683_conv:13367_3_509
It'll be okay I promise.  First few days will be weird but you'll slip in no problem once you adjust to your schedule.	hit:6683_conv:13367_4_97
My mother died, I'm a mess.	hit:6685_conv:13371_1_509

Thank you :(	hit:6685_conv:13371_3_509
it gets better with time but it must be hard	hit:6685_conv:13371_4_63
I really miss Hastings.  I spent so much time in that store when I first started college.  Both just hanging out and working.	hit:6688_conv:13377_1_97
I remember that store! I loved going shopping there, was it your first job?	hit:6688_conv:13377_2_448
It wasn't my first but it was my most favorite retail job I had	hit:6688_conv:13377_3_97
Yeah, I bet, it looked like a fun place to work.  Especially for a college job.	hit:6688_conv:13377_4_448
It really was.  It was so  laid back and chill.  I also made a ton of great friends there.	hit:6688_conv:13377_5_97
I pray I can do well in school	hit:6695_conv:13391_1_509
Are you having any specific problem areas?	hit:6695_conv:13391_2_225

Okay. I hope you do well too.	hit:6695_conv:13391_4_225
I've really wanted a Ford Excursion for a long time.	hit:6696_conv:13393_1_305
Interesting, those things are huge, Do they even make them any more?	hit:6696_conv:13393_2_290
They haven't made them for quite a few years.  But I met a guy that just picked one up in the last few days!	hit:6696_conv:13393_3_305
Do you have a large family, or do you just like the idea of a large SUV?	hit:6696_conv:13393_4_290
We don't have a huge family, just 5.  But my wife does daycare, and our current vehicle only has 5 seats, so she's stuck at home fairly frequently.	hit:6696_conv:13393_5_305
5 is fairly large i would say. I hope you get your giant car one day.	hit:6696_conv:13393_6_290
Thanks!  If not, we'll still manage just fine.  It would be nice, though.	hit:6696_conv:13393_7_305
I'm scared to go to the cottage	hit:6702_conv:13404_1_509
It is a big change. What is scaring you?	hit:6702_conv:13404_2_262
I don't like bugs!	hit:6702_conv:13404_3_509
I hate bugs too. You should exterminate before you move in	hit:6702_conv:13404_4_262
I am sad my cousin is moving away.	hit:6709_conv:13419_1_509
Is it really far?	hit:6709_conv:13419_2_262
Yes, another country	hit:6709_conv:13419_3_509
oh no. im sorry to hear that	hit:6709_conv:13419_4_262
I had some friends over and went upstairs to my room.  All the lights were off and when I left my room a bat flew at me and landed on my leg.	hit:6710_conv:13421_1_318
Well, that would be terrifying! Were you afraid that a vampire was there?	hit:6710_conv:13421_2_45
Hahahaha, that piece hadnt crossed my mind although it should have with all the vampire movies I had seen!  I let out a scream and one of my friends captured the bat and let it outside to be free.	hit:6710_conv:13421_3_318
Well, that would be very creepy! They would hear my scream in the next town over!	hit:6710_conv:13421_4_45
I was totally ready for my garage sale	hit:6711_conv:13422_1_509
You were ready? That's good to hear.	hit:6711_conv:13422_2_244
Yes and we made $1026.25!	hit:6711_conv:13422_3_509
Aweomse.  Treat yo self.gif	hit:6711_conv:13422_4_244
I have an interview coming up.  Its for a position that someone else already has but I need to do this interview to get my name out there and let the higher ups know I want to move into management.	hit:6713_conv:13426_1_318
Are you prepared?	hit:6713_conv:13426_2_262
I am prepared for it.  I'll be a lot happier once it is over.	hit:6713_conv:13426_3_318
I bet. Good luck to you	hit:6713_conv:13426_4_262
I went to work the other day, and I was the only person in the office.	hit:6718_conv:13437_1_305
Where you supposed to be there? If so, then that is a nice feeling.	hit:6718_conv:13437_2_297
Yeah, everyone else was just gone.  It was nice for a while, but got a bit lonely.	hit:6718_conv:13437_3_305
Oh I see. That could make the time go slow also. 	hit:6718_conv:13437_4_297
It did toward the end of the day for sure!	hit:6718_conv:13437_5_305
I am starting back at school next month. I am excited about getting back into my classes.	hit:6719_conv:13439_1_573
That's great. What classes are you taking?	hit:6719_conv:13439_2_244
I'm a computer science student. The one I'm most excited about is Microprocessors.	hit:6719_conv:13439_3_573
That's pretty cool... Are you going to go towards hardware or stick with programming?	hit:6719_conv:13439_4_244
I want to be a software developer I think, so I like the programming.	hit:6719_conv:13439_5_573
You should go all out and get a EE degree to go with it.  You can do microprocessor design.	hit:6719_conv:13439_6_244
I really like school, so you never know what I might decide to go for next. Thank you for the advice.	hit:6719_conv:13439_7_573
Any time. Have a good weekend :D	hit:6719_conv:13439_8_244
My dog just died in my arms.	hit:6721_conv:13443_1_509
Did that happen tonight?	hit:6721_conv:13443_2_543
No, it was a few years ago.	hit:6721_conv:13443_3_509
Well, it must've been something you said.	hit:6721_conv:13443_4_543
My step-daughter just turned 16 in the past week.	hit:6722_conv:13445_1_305
Did she have a party?	hit:6722_conv:13445_2_570
We're actually having it this coming weekend.	hit:6722_conv:13445_3_305
Does she have her license yet?	hit:6722_conv:13445_4_570
No . . . that's a long story involving her idiot father.  I'm somewhat glad, though, as she can't seem to set her phone down.	hit:6722_conv:13445_5_305
Well, there's no hurry in driving, is there? What does she do mostly on her phone? Text??	hit:6722_conv:13445_6_570
Text, video chat, watch some goofball put makeup on, and shop.  Things most teenagers do, I suppose.	hit:6722_conv:13445_7_305
Does she play any sports?	hit:6722_conv:13445_8_570
I watch my girlfriends dog every once in a while and she just isnt getting potty training.  She is a little over 5 months old and some weeks she does a great job and the next week she'll go to the bathroom everywhere but outside.	hit:6723_conv:13447_1_318
That's super frustrating! I've only ever had outside pets so I can't really offer advice, but it's one of those things where your anger is all misplaced because you know you can't really be upset with the dog since it doesn't know any better.	hit:6723_conv:13447_2_545
I do understand that part too.  I actually got a puppy a couple months before her so I went through this all.  I just wish her puppy listened as well as mine because he took a couple months as has been doing great since.  I know it'll click eventually...I just wish shed hurry up :)	hit:6723_conv:13447_3_318
It'll be well worth it when she gets the hang of it, but urgh. Bathroom problems are why I don't think I want a kid anytime soon!	hit:6723_conv:13447_4_545
I was shocked by my present.	hit:6725_conv:13450_1_509
You got a present? How lovely! What was the occasion?	hit:6725_conv:13450_2_343
It was my anniversary.	hit:6725_conv:13450_3_509
Well, happy anniversary! What was your present?	hit:6725_conv:13450_4_343
Humanity is the worst.	hit:6727_conv:13454_1_509
I agree.. Did something happen?	hit:6727_conv:13454_2_160
No, just frustrated	hit:6727_conv:13454_3_509
I'm sorry.. Not everyone is bad.  Just a lot of people.	hit:6727_conv:13454_4_160
My mom spent a lot of money buying me a computer for my birthday	hit:6747_conv:13495_1_547
That was nice	hit:6747_conv:13495_2_262
Yes, I love my mom and I will give her something even better for her birthday!	hit:6747_conv:13495_3_547
Do you have anything in mind?	hit:6747_conv:13495_4_262
My old roommate never did any dishes.  He also didnt wash any food off the plates so we had a sink full of dirty dishes and rotting food at all time.  It was miserable living there.	hit:6764_conv:13529_1_318
So, I take you left to live someplace else?	hit:6764_conv:13529_2_75
Haha yes, I ended up saving up then moving out and buying my own place.  I wont miss the flies sitting around the kitchen and he's still just as messy...now its on his own though instead of with other people.	hit:6764_conv:13529_3_318
Just remember to never invite you ex-roomate to your new place, EVER!!!!!!	hit:6764_conv:13529_4_75
I recently tried to get a manager's job in my company, two others and myself were the last three in the running for the job.	hit:6768_conv:13536_1_340
Very nice, congrats on making it that far. I actually was in the same situation about a week ago.  How do you feel you match up to the others?	hit:6768_conv:13536_2_318
I had much more experience than both of them, but ended up not getting the job. I am still pretty upset about it.	hit:6768_conv:13536_3_340
I would be upset too.  However, I wouldnt get discouraged though.  There may be another opportunity even better that comes along soon.	hit:6768_conv:13536_4_318
My little brother graduated not too long ago.  He had to work hard but he made it through college	hit:6768_conv:13537_1_318
That's great, it's good to see people finish what they start. You must be very proud.	hit:6768_conv:13537_2_340
I was.  I know how hard it was for him so it was great seeing that hard work pay off in the long run.	hit:6768_conv:13537_3_318
Well, hopefully there will be nothing but great things for him in his future.	hit:6768_conv:13537_4_340
My little brother graduated not too long ago.  He had to work hard but made it through it.	hit:6770_conv:13540_1_318
I am so glad to hear that.  Did he find a job?	hit:6770_conv:13540_2_274
He did!  He actually just started a new job that he loves and is related to his degree.	hit:6770_conv:13540_3_318
That is good to hear.  What will he be doing?	hit:6770_conv:13540_4_274
My girlfriend is moving in this weekend.  It will be great finally living together.	hit:6772_conv:13544_1_318
Oh that's wonderful! How long have you two been dating?	hit:6772_conv:13544_2_356
We have been dating almost a year.  I'm just excited to take this next step in the relationship.	hit:6772_conv:13544_3_318
It's a huge step, congratulations! 	hit:6772_conv:13544_4_356
My girlfriends aunt just died.  She wasnt close to her but is still devastated because of the impact it had on her sister.  I'm doing whatever I can to help them both.	hit:6774_conv:13549_1_318
Sometimes deaths affect us even when we're not really close.	hit:6774_conv:13549_2_225
Thats very true.  I know she feels bad for not keeping as close contact as she could have with her aunt now.	hit:6774_conv:13549_3_318
Guilt can be a terrible thing to live with.	hit:6774_conv:13549_4_225
My friend and coworker hasnt been coming into work.  People are starting to talk but its hard to stick up for him when he only comes in once or twice a week.	hit:6777_conv:13554_1_318
Is he sick or just being lazy?	hit:6777_conv:13554_2_278
A little bit of both.  He has bad anxiety but he also has told me he just doesnt like going into work.	hit:6777_conv:13554_3_318
I hope he can get the help he needs and maybe a job he enjoys more.	hit:6777_conv:13554_4_278
One time during Kindergarten, I peed myself because the teacher did not let me go to the restroom	hit:6785_conv:13570_1_547
Oh, well that's awful on a little person! I never liked it when a teacher did that when a child needed to go to the bathroom!	hit:6785_conv:13570_2_45
Thanks! Luckily I am potty trained now!	hit:6785_conv:13570_3_547
LOL, well, that's good to know. So am I!	hit:6785_conv:13570_4_45
One of my well knows patients that has horrible diabetes came in today for a follow up. 	hit:6787_conv:13574_1_567
Is your patient improving an following good medical advice?	hit:6787_conv:13574_2_277
Yes. After 3 years of working with her she finally started to take her medication as prescribed as well as watch her carb and sugar intake. I checked her blood sugar today and to my suprise it was normal!	hit:6787_conv:13574_3_567
That would be a surprise.  A lot of people are not dedicated enough to change their condition, especially those with diabetes.	hit:6787_conv:13574_4_277
I agree!. I was so proud of her and her test results surprised me! 	hit:6787_conv:13574_5_567
The first time my girlfriend slept over I farted on her leg in the middle of the night.  She knew it happened but didnt say anything.  She also doesnt know that I know.	hit:6796_conv:13592_1_318
Thats... uh... strange?	hit:6796_conv:13592_2_244
It was embarrassing but I think that she stayed with me is after is a good sign!	hit:6796_conv:13592_3_318
I think so, you're two peas in a pod.	hit:6796_conv:13592_4_244
I'm trying to get some work done and my dog just wants to play!  I love him to death but he needs to learn to be independent at times too!	hit:6799_conv:13599_1_318
Pets are great, but they can be a bit needy for attention at times. It is great, but not when you are busy and trying to get things done.	hit:6799_conv:13599_2_45
Thats very true.  After our first conversation I might have to take a break and play with him a bit.  I might have to log off and go on a sort walk to tire him out.	hit:6799_conv:13599_3_318
A walk will definitely help. He will probably be ready for a nap when you get back, then you can get some work done.	hit:6799_conv:13599_4_45
One time when I was letting my cat outside, it ran out into the streets and got ran over	hit:6800_conv:13601_1_547
Oh my god! That's terrible!	hit:6800_conv:13601_2_478
Then I woke up, it was all a dream.	hit:6800_conv:13601_3_547
Oh that's so great!	hit:6800_conv:13601_4_478
my son just won first place at his championship swim meet!	hit:6802_conv:13604_1_475
That's amazing!  Congratulations!  Swimming can be tough	hit:6802_conv:13604_2_527
Thank you! He takes to it like a fish in water. HaHA!	hit:6802_conv:13604_3_475
LOL I bet you use that line all the time!  I love it	hit:6802_conv:13604_4_527
One time when using the public restroom, I had toilet paper hanging from my shoe when I went outside	hit:6804_conv:13609_1_547
Oh man! I hope no one noticed. 	hit:6804_conv:13609_2_478
Unfortunately I kept getting looks! It's alright though!	hit:6804_conv:13609_3_547
I'm glad that it all worked out!	hit:6804_conv:13609_4_478
I have a goal I want to get on here tonight but my dog really wants to play.  I feel bad that I'm not playing with him but would really like to hit my goal before I do.	hit:6810_conv:13621_1_318
Oh, I bet you are really torn.	hit:6810_conv:13621_2_576
I am, I would think I'll be done pretty soon and then take him for a nice long walk.	hit:6810_conv:13621_3_318
I'm sure he will love that. I bet you will see the joy just shining in his eyes.	hit:6810_conv:13621_4_576
My girlfriend broke up with me recently	hit:6813_conv:13626_1_111
That's one of the hardest parts of life. What happened??	hit:6813_conv:13626_2_296
We drifted apart it seems	hit:6813_conv:13626_3_111
That is hard! Relationships are hard work.	hit:6813_conv:13626_4_296
A friend of mine drove me to work when my car broke down	hit:6814_conv:13629_1_111
That is great of them, did you do anything to pay them back?	hit:6814_conv:13629_2_10
I took him out to dinner later on, he's a good friend	hit:6814_conv:13629_3_111
That is nice of you, glad you have supportive friends!	hit:6814_conv:13629_4_10
I saw a mouse run across my kitchen floor	hit:6818_conv:13637_1_111
Aw poor mouse. I have had a few before..We actually rescued a few from our cat :/ 	hit:6818_conv:13637_2_296
I hope I can catch it at some point	hit:6818_conv:13637_3_111
They have live traps to catch and release that are only a couple bucks. Mice really are sweet natured.	hit:6818_conv:13637_4_296
A co-worker of mine was late with work materials	hit:6820_conv:13641_1_111
What happened to them?	hit:6820_conv:13641_2_10
I eventually got them, but it almost cost me this project I've been working on	hit:6820_conv:13641_3_111
Good, sorry you were inconvenienced, hope things get more consistent!	hit:6820_conv:13641_4_10
I was watching my girlfriends son the other weekend and was trying to think of an activity we could do together.  I decided on cooking and got everything before he came over.	hit:6823_conv:13647_1_318
that sounds like fun. for some reason kids really enjoy cooking.	hit:6823_conv:13647_2_463
Yeah, he seemed to have a good time.  We made cheese too which was a first for both of us.  It turned out pretty good too which was nice.	hit:6823_conv:13647_3_318
that sounds like fun. i want to try to make mozzerella	hit:6823_conv:13647_4_463
I am nervous for my college test	hit:6829_conv:13659_1_259
Did you study for it at least?	hit:6829_conv:13659_2_10
I did but it is a law school exam. You just never know.	hit:6829_conv:13659_3_259
That is true, well best of luck to you friend!	hit:6829_conv:13659_4_10
I was walking around my office and someone spilled coffee on me	hit:6832_conv:13664_1_111
That is bad. What did you do after that?	hit:6832_conv:13664_2_7
I went to the bathroom to clean up, it was a new shirt as well	hit:6832_conv:13664_3_111
Did he say sorry?	hit:6832_conv:13664_4_7
When I came home, a TV show I had set to record was all ready to go	hit:6840_conv:13681_1_111
What show was it?	hit:6840_conv:13681_2_10
Black Mirror	hit:6840_conv:13681_3_111
is that the one with Bryce Dallas Howard?	hit:6840_conv:13681_4_10
I keep remembering my old college days	hit:6844_conv:13689_1_259
Oh? What about them?	hit:6844_conv:13689_2_385
Just how fun and carefree they were.	hit:6844_conv:13689_3_259
That's true. Any memory in particular?	hit:6844_conv:13689_4_385
I'm spending my first summer in Massachusetts. It's a lot hotter than I expected it to be.	hit:6856_conv:13713_1_573
Is it really? How hot is it there?	hit:6856_conv:13713_2_10
The hottest it got was 99 degrees. It has been in the mid 80s mostly, but I was expecting cooler weather in New England.	hit:6856_conv:13713_3_573
That is hot, but it is a bit hotter where I live here	hit:6856_conv:13713_4_10
I don't like it at all, but I can put up with it until fall.	hit:6856_conv:13713_5_573
I was all alone when my family left for the weekend.	hit:6873_conv:13747_1_259
Did you feel lonely, or were you happy to have some time to yourelf?	hit:6873_conv:13747_2_294
A bit sad. More bored than anything.	hit:6873_conv:13747_3_259
That is tough when you're not used to being alone.  What did you end up doing?	hit:6873_conv:13747_4_294
I'm looking forward to meeting with some friends on the weekend	hit:6880_conv:13760_1_111
Oh that's cool!  What do you all have planned?	hit:6880_conv:13760_2_525
Probably go hiking and visit some local towns	hit:6880_conv:13760_3_111
Well that sounds like a fun little trip.	hit:6880_conv:13760_4_525
After a long day I finally got my dog settled down and I dont have any work.  It feels nice to just sit for a little bit.	hit:6898_conv:13796_1_318
thats nice to be able to relax	hit:6898_conv:13796_2_238
Have you had a good day?  Hopefully you dont have a busy weekend and can relax a little bit.	hit:6898_conv:13796_3_318
everyday is a good day!	hit:6898_conv:13796_4_238

I had an online interview today for a teaching position and I nailed it!	hit:6969_conv:13939_1_580
Awesome! I am happy for you!	hit:6969_conv:13939_2_123
Thanks! Regardless I am a bit nervous. There are a lot of things to remember and I don't want to look like a fool on the job.	hit:6969_conv:13939_3_580
I am sure you will do fine! Good Luck!	hit:6969_conv:13939_4_123
I found out recently that my girlfriend's cat has cancer and we cannot afford the operation to remove it.	hit:6974_conv:13948_1_580
Oh I am so sorry. Best thing to do is be there for her.	hit:6974_conv:13948_2_297
Thank you for your sympathies. Have you ever dealt with losing a pet?	hit:6974_conv:13948_3_580
I have and it really hard. It just takes time But a good support system makes it way better.	hit:6974_conv:13948_4_297
I'm happy to hear you were able to get through it over time.	hit:6974_conv:13948_5_580
My girlfriend was having a bad day at work a few days ago.	hit:6980_conv:13960_1_580

Definitely. I aced it, and now I'm officially in a trial period!	hit:6983_conv:13967_3_580

A while back, I intervened when I saw my dad was picking on my younger sister.	hit:6986_conv:13973_1_580
That was good of you.  He didn't hurt her did he?	hit:6986_conv:13973_2_389
No, but he was just being mean. So mean he decided to kick me out of the house.	hit:6986_conv:13973_3_580
Oh no!!! Where did you end up going?	hit:6986_conv:13973_4_389
To my girlfriend's place. Luckily it only lasted a week, and my Mom is super caring and loving. She took me back in against his wishes.	hit:6986_conv:13973_5_580
That was so awesome of your mom :)	hit:6986_conv:13973_6_389
Walking home alone from school one day, three young adults jumped in front of me and yelled in my face.	hit:6993_conv:13987_1_580
Why did they do that?	hit:6993_conv:13987_2_7
For no good reason; there are evil people in this world. I was so scared I cried on the way back home.	hit:6993_conv:13987_3_580
That is terrible. Those days, a lot of people do stupid things.	hit:6993_conv:13987_4_7
I wasn't sure how he would do since he didn't go to PreK.	hit:7003_conv:14006_1_147
Children usually do really well, they are versatile. 	hit:7003_conv:14006_2_123
I have heard that, but now I truly believe that!	hit:7003_conv:14006_3_147
I hope he continues to do well.	hit:7003_conv:14006_4_123
My daughter is officially all grown up she is leaving and going off to college next week. 	hit:7019_conv:14038_1_284
Are you excited or will it be lonely? 	hit:7019_conv:14038_2_243
In between I am very positive that she will be ok but just the thought of your first born going into the real world away from you is scary a little but I know she will be just fine. 	hit:7019_conv:14038_3_284
Yeah that is scary. I am sure she will do great things though!	hit:7019_conv:14038_4_243
My kids was away all summer I missed them like crazy when they was gone.	hit:7024_conv:14049_1_284
I bet it was really quiet and lonely. Did you find some time for yourself though?	hit:7024_conv:14049_2_243
A little to quite and I was very lonely I'm glad it's over lol I started isolating my self to much when they was away. 	hit:7024_conv:14049_3_284
I don't think I would like that quiet either.	hit:7024_conv:14049_4_243
I know I have high potential so the fact I failed my college course had me down.	hit:7030_conv:14060_1_284
Well that's not good. I'm sorry to hear that. Do you think maybe you were just too nervous during the test?	hit:7030_conv:14060_2_286
The test and the whole semester I just didn't give it my all like I should have and now I feel really crappy and regretful I need to redo course and give it my all.	hit:7030_conv:14060_3_284
Never be too confident! You've got to give life your all at every step.	hit:7030_conv:14060_4_286
Some restaurants just have the worst workers they are so rude and mean to us the customers. 	hit:7036_conv:14072_1_284
I agree. I dont know why they work in the service industry if they don't like to be nice	hit:7036_conv:14072_2_397
Exactly what is even worse is the managers who are just as rude, I get so upset I had this happen to me at Wendy's staff was so unprofessional. 	hit:7036_conv:14072_3_284
Fast food employees are the worst sometimes... it's like we bother them	hit:7036_conv:14072_4_397
I will officially be a first time home owner next month. 	hit:7040_conv:14080_1_284
How exciting!!!  I bet you are thinking already about  how you want to decorate it and fix up the lawn, etc..	hit:7040_conv:14080_2_56
I am this is all I ever wanted for my family and it is about to come I am so thrilled with joy can't wait. 	hit:7040_conv:14080_3_284
I can imagine!  It is certainly an exciting time.  I bet you are just over the moon happy!	hit:7040_conv:14080_4_56
Do you have any experience about it	hit:7045_conv:14090_1_508
Any experience with what?	hit:7045_conv:14090_2_397
Anything that made you happy	hit:7045_conv:14090_3_508
Yes some things	hit:7045_conv:14090_4_397
can you share anything	hit:7045_conv:14090_5_508
I packed a sandwich before I went to work	hit:7050_conv:14100_1_547
Are you trying to save money by not eating out at work?	hit:7050_conv:14100_2_56
Yup, and I am too lazy to drive out to a restaurant!	hit:7050_conv:14100_3_547
Well, it can save you a bunch of money!  Plus you gain the time that you would normally spend going out somewhere and you can use that time to have more of a break.	hit:7050_conv:14100_4_56
One time I saw poop smeared all over the public restroom	hit:7053_conv:14106_1_547
Oh my! I bet you was so disgusted that you ran out of there. 	hit:7053_conv:14106_2_576
Yup the smell was disgusting!	hit:7053_conv:14106_3_547
Yikes! Why in the world would somebody do that?	hit:7053_conv:14106_4_576
One time I looked at the mirror and thought I saw a monster	hit:7055_conv:14111_1_547
Whoa! That is really scary! I've felt weird sensations like that before.	hit:7055_conv:14111_2_366
Yeah. Unfortunately, it was a monster! I am just ugly!	hit:7055_conv:14111_3_547
No! I'm sure you are not as monster-ish as you think!	hit:7055_conv:14111_4_366
My mom spent a lot of money to buy me a computer	hit:7057_conv:14115_1_547
Aw that's nnice of her	hit:7057_conv:14115_2_397
Yup! She worked hard for like 3 weeks to save up for it! I love her!	hit:7057_conv:14115_3_547

One time while I was camping, there was a giant rattle snake trying to attack us	hit:7079_conv:14159_1_547
Did you kill the snake?	hit:7079_conv:14159_2_4
Nope! I packed up and went straight home!	hit:7079_conv:14159_3_547
That is too bad, will you ever camp again?	hit:7079_conv:14159_4_4
I had business meeting about a year ago where I had to rely a lot on my co-worker.	hit:7119_conv:14238_1_326
Did they do a good job?	hit:7119_conv:14238_2_4
Surprisingly they he did, I guess sometimes we I need to trust people.	hit:7119_conv:14238_3_326
Did you take them out for drinks after the meeting?	hit:7119_conv:14238_4_4
I had dumplings at a hotel yesterday, and for a hotel restaurant food they were actually good.	hit:7220_conv:14440_1_326
sounds awesome	hit:7220_conv:14440_2_63
Yes, it was a tasty lunch.	hit:7220_conv:14440_3_326
i would have loved to do the same	hit:7220_conv:14440_4_63
I got into an argument the other day with my 18 year old son.  I still feel badly about it	hit:7221_conv:14443_1_587
Did you resolve things?	hit:7221_conv:14443_2_322
Yes eventually, but I am sorry to admit that I said things I should have never said to him out of anger.	hit:7221_conv:14443_3_587
I hope you can get over that pain.	hit:7221_conv:14443_4_322
Thanks, me too.  I should have remained calm and not called him names and say things I didnt mean.	hit:7221_conv:14443_5_587
One time I bought a scratch lottery ticket and won $20!	hit:7261_conv:14523_1_547
That's awesome! It would be amazing to win a million one day. One can dream.	hit:7261_conv:14523_2_64
Yup, I am going to buy another one just because of you! I hope I win!	hit:7261_conv:14523_3_547
That's great. I hope you do! Maybe this time you can get $40. But gamble only in moderation!	hit:7261_conv:14523_4_64
I was upset when my family kept leaving me on vacation	hit:7293_conv:14587_1_259
That is really upsetting!	hit:7293_conv:14587_2_478
It was. I just wanted some quality family time.	hit:7293_conv:14587_3_259
Well forget them! If they don't care about you you don't need to care about them	hit:7293_conv:14587_4_478
My cousin and I used to beat eachother with sticks.	hit:7295_conv:14590_1_588
for fun?	hit:7295_conv:14590_2_259
Yeah. We called it the box game and walked around inside of a refrigerator box for protection.	hit:7295_conv:14590_3_588
well that sounds pretty fun!	hit:7295_conv:14590_4_259
I was very well prepared for my law exam.	hit:7295_conv:14591_1_259
Were you satisfied with the results?	hit:7295_conv:14591_2_588
I was! 95%	hit:7295_conv:14591_3_259
Excellent!	hit:7295_conv:14591_4_588
I enthusiastically told my family about everything wrong with my life at that point.	hit:7300_conv:14601_1_588
how did it go	hit:7300_conv:14601_2_238
Not good. I was very drunk though	hit:7300_conv:14601_3_588
oh well maybe next time	hit:7300_conv:14601_4_238
Quitting smoking was so much easier than I expected it to be!	hit:7303_conv:14606_1_588
how many days has it been?	hit:7303_conv:14606_2_238
2 years	hit:7303_conv:14606_3_588
wow thats great!	hit:7303_conv:14606_4_238
I was grossed out when I saw someone vomit outside a bar.	hit:7304_conv:14608_1_259
Drunk people can get pretty disgusting in general.	hit:7304_conv:14608_2_244
For sure. it was not a pretty sight.	hit:7304_conv:14608_3_259
Some people can't hold their liquor.	hit:7304_conv:14608_4_244
Life is a lot better when you can eat solid food. Never get your jaw wired shut it sucks.	hit:7310_conv:14621_1_588
I can imagine. What happend that you got your jaw wired?	hit:7310_conv:14621_2_478
I got punched while drunk without a mouth guard years ago - still think about it !	hit:7310_conv:14621_3_588
Man that sounds aweful.	hit:7310_conv:14621_4_478
Life is good right now for me too	hit:7316_conv:14633_1_588
Nice.  Always feels good to be at the top knowing nothing can't touch you	hit:7316_conv:14633_2_119
Right just staying active, don't need much money, minimal drama. Easy	hit:7316_conv:14633_3_588
Absolutely	hit:7316_conv:14633_4_119
I used to feel lonely a lot as a teenager. That was dumb of me	hit:7320_conv:14640_1_588
I feel like everyone goes through that phase.  I know I did too	hit:7320_conv:14640_2_119
I've noticed that it's easier to be happy while not around someone all the time.	hit:7320_conv:14640_3_588
Would you say you're more of an introvert?	hit:7320_conv:14640_4_119
August is way too hot.	hit:7327_conv:14654_1_588
Especially in the south	hit:7327_conv:14654_2_126
Right. I live as north as you're gonna get in the US and it still sucks.	hit:7327_conv:14654_3_588
Oh wow, that does sound horrible	hit:7327_conv:14654_4_126
GED test was super easy. I was confident that I would pass it	hit:7373_conv:14747_1_588
did you find out the results?	hit:7373_conv:14747_2_238
Yeah I crushed	hit:7373_conv:14747_3_588
dang thats awesome!	hit:7373_conv:14747_4_238
Two years ago I decided to go back to school after working at my job for 12 years. At the time I was very nervous about my decision.	hit:7402_conv:14805_1_573
Oh wow and you couldn't keep your job? What were you going to school for?	hit:7402_conv:14805_2_296
I still work there, but just part time now. I am studying Computer Science.	hit:7402_conv:14805_3_573
Oh wonderful! One of the best fields to be in right now	hit:7402_conv:14805_4_296
I love it. Just ten more classes to go until I finish.	hit:7402_conv:14805_5_573
Wow! Good luck, there are so many things you can do with that degree and from home too!	hit:7402_conv:14805_6_296
Thank you! I hope to work from home.	hit:7402_conv:14805_7_573
My grandparents have been married for 50 years I hope to be like that one day.	hit:7447_conv:14895_1_284
That is awesome. I never even get a second date A husband may not be in the cards lol	hit:7447_conv:14895_2_27
lol you just haven't came across the right person yet. It is incredible I arranged and had them a surprise dinner party it turned out very nice.	hit:7447_conv:14895_3_284
Thats sweet. I bet they enjoyed it	hit:7447_conv:14895_4_27
Here in Florida the traffic and wrecks is bad and always happening. 	hit:7452_conv:14905_1_284
I hate bad traffic, did you get in an accident?	hit:7452_conv:14905_2_375
Due to a reckless driver running the red light, but most wrecks I have witnessed come from careless drivers or drivers driving slow in the fast lane and get tail ended I get so irritated I swear. 	hit:7452_conv:14905_3_284
That's the worst, I hate when people are careless.	hit:7452_conv:14905_4_375
I get so angry when people stand me up it's so rude.	hit:7455_conv:14911_1_284
I know what you mean	hit:7455_conv:14911_2_27
My coworker did this recent we was suppose to have lunch she didn't call or anything. 	hit:7455_conv:14911_3_284
that sucks. have you talked to her?	hit:7455_conv:14911_4_27
Seen her at work but she has been avoiding me even more rude but never again will I plan an outing with her. 	hit:7455_conv:14911_5_284
Professional settings is suppose to get along and be great but not my place of work staff fight like cats and dogs there. 	hit:7464_conv:14929_1_284
That is awful.  I agree.  A professional setting is supposed to be ... well, professional.  What steps are being taken to correct that?	hit:7464_conv:14929_2_485
We have a team building coming up and let's hope this works which I predict it will be some type of good outcome. 	hit:7464_conv:14929_3_284
I agree.  I hope it will be.  Team building, communication, and professionalism will all help a company.  I think this is why so many companies fail.  	hit:7464_conv:14929_4_485
I just drove 12 hours back from my parents' house. It wasn't so bad though, because I actually packed everything I needed for once. I was able to minimize the amount of stops I took and cut two hours off of the total time it took!	hit:7483_conv:14967_1_513
Wow, you do really live far from your parents. Do you go to college or work?	hit:7483_conv:14967_2_155
I work. We moved far from where they grew up when I was young, and they ended up moving back for retirement. 	hit:7483_conv:14967_3_513
I see. Well, it seems as people get older they want to go back to places which reminds them of past. Nostalgia probably helps them cope with passing life	hit:7483_conv:14967_4_155
I was pretty bummed to find out that my favorite coworker is transferring to a different department.	hit:7489_conv:14979_1_513
I can see how that would be a downer.  Will you still get to see them?	hit:7489_conv:14979_2_56
Once in a while, here and there.	hit:7489_conv:14979_3_513
At least they aren't gone completely, but I can understand how that would affect your day to day work life.	hit:7489_conv:14979_4_56
I prequalified for a mortgage last week online. The bank I applied with has called me 3 times a day ever since. I'm getting pretty frustrated.	hit:7495_conv:14990_1_513
i would be really annoyed myself, why so many frequent calls ?	hit:7495_conv:14990_2_321
I'm not sure. This is my first time shopping for a mortgage, so I'm not sure if it's normal or not.	hit:7495_conv:14990_3_513
i know ever since i purchased a new car, i know for a fact i did not read the fine print but insurance companys call me almost every day multiple times a day , its really annoying 	hit:7495_conv:14990_4_321
I watched Wimbledon for the first time last summer. Those tennis players are SO GOOD!	hit:7499_conv:14999_1_513
I know right! my parents love tennis, so I grw up watching it.	hit:7499_conv:14999_2_445
I had played a little bit growing up, but never watched it professionally. 	hit:7499_conv:14999_3_513
were you ever any good at it?	hit:7499_conv:14999_4_445
It was so life-like and I have such fond memories of playing in there.  My stepdad worked for pillsbury and brought home dough and I would pretend I was baking.	hit:7504_conv:15008_1_587
Good for you to have such memorable experience to have and remember of. Can you bake now for real?	hit:7504_conv:15008_2_155
Yes somewhat, although with all that practice in childhood I should be much better.   I miss my stepdad so much.   I have nothing but fond memories of him.	hit:7504_conv:15008_3_587
Are you still in contact with him?	hit:7504_conv:15008_4_155
I looked at a house I really liked last week, but just found out it was taken off the market.	hit:7506_conv:15012_1_513
Oh that sucks. I hate when that happens.	hit:7506_conv:15012_2_530
Yeah, it'll be okay though. There's always something else that will come available.	hit:7506_conv:15012_3_513
I bet the next house you look at will be amazing and even better than that one.	hit:7506_conv:15012_4_530
I had to drive 12 hours straight last week. For once it wasn't terrible, because I packed everything I needed. Took two hours fewer than it normally does!	hit:7510_conv:15021_1_513
That sounds exhausting! Were you driving for work or just taking a vacation?	hit:7510_conv:15021_2_592
Vacation. Went to go visit my parents.	hit:7510_conv:15021_3_513
I'm sure the drives worth it since you get to spend time with the family.	hit:7510_conv:15021_4_592
I came home from work, expecting an empty apartment. My boyfriend was home from his trip a day early!	hit:7531_conv:15062_1_513
Was he alone?	hit:7531_conv:15062_2_262
Yes, I was very excited to see him.	hit:7531_conv:15062_3_513
Cool. Did you do something special?	hit:7531_conv:15062_4_262

Thank you!	hit:7537_conv:15075_3_513
Do you get a raise?	hit:7537_conv:15075_4_262
My bank has called me three times a day for the past week, and I'm tired of it.	hit:7540_conv:15081_1_513
Probably they noticed some irregular or even fraudulent activities associated with your account	hit:7540_conv:15081_2_155
No, I prequalified for a mortgage, and they've been wanting me to speak to a loan specialist ever since.	hit:7540_conv:15081_3_513
Are you interested in mortgage for now?	hit:7540_conv:15081_4_155
My roommate leaves her leftovers in the fridge for a disgusting amount of time.	hit:7543_conv:15087_1_513
Oh that is really gross! Have you talked to her about it?	hit:7543_conv:15087_2_332
No, I don't feel like it's my place to tell her what to do.	hit:7543_conv:15087_3_513
If you share the fridge, I'd let her know if it causes an odor or might affect the other food.	hit:7543_conv:15087_4_332
I came home expecting an empty apartment, but my boyfriend had come home a day early from his trip!	hit:7544_conv:15088_1_513
cool. did he have gifts?	hit:7544_conv:15088_2_262
No, but I'm not big on gifts.	hit:7544_conv:15088_3_513
Oh. I am lol	hit:7544_conv:15088_4_262
Do you feel anything like that	hit:7546_conv:15093_1_508
Like what? Bad or miserable?	hit:7546_conv:15093_2_155
sad, when you see beggar in the street	hit:7546_conv:15093_3_508
Yes indeed. Seeing people less fortunate than me makes go to pieces	hit:7546_conv:15093_4_155
What do you think when you see them	hit:7546_conv:15093_5_508
Next month my wife and I are going on our first vacation, I can hardly wait.	hit:7547_conv:15095_1_340
Wow. enjoy your own time.	hit:7547_conv:15095_2_43
I will, it is going to be great to get away together.	hit:7547_conv:15095_3_340
Yeah, you're right. Hope you've memorable vacation.	hit:7547_conv:15095_4_43
My ex boyfriend and I started having trouble getting along and we were under a lot of stress over money.   After awhile of this he started putting a password on his cell phone so I couldnt get in to see his messages.  THat was the first sign!	hit:7559_conv:15119_1_587
Wao,thats really not cool	hit:7559_conv:15119_2_181
NO, not cool at all.  We ended up breaking up for a bit and he didnt waste any time before seeing this girl.   I wasted four years of my life for that to happen.   	hit:7559_conv:15119_3_587
He doesnt deserve you,so wipe your tears	hit:7559_conv:15119_4_181
I found myself suddenly by myself and it seemed as if all the people I had become friends with were no longer wanting to still be friends.  I mostly met all of them through him when we got together, and when he left me he told them not to speak to me anymore and they listened.	hit:7619_conv:15238_1_587
That's sad. But I'm sure they stil want to be firends with you too	hit:7619_conv:15238_2_196
I dont think they do.  He was an abusive guy and he didnt want me to have them as friends and he would make up lies about me .  I dont think it was so much the lies he made up because they knew they were not true.  I think they were just loyal to him.	hit:7619_conv:15238_3_587
Posibly. Sounds like you are better off without him though	hit:7619_conv:15238_4_196
I love it when the buildbuilding is comingfrom me	hit:7637_conv:15275_1_153
That's awesome, I wish I could build my own house.	hit:7637_conv:15275_2_77
Is the conversation over? You are welcome then.	hit:7637_conv:15275_3_153
Well thank you as well.	hit:7637_conv:15275_4_77
Her name was Lily and she was a pit bull, my favorite breed.   I loved her so much.  We did everything together.  She would go wherever I did.	hit:7639_conv:15278_1_587
Did she die recently?	hit:7639_conv:15278_2_408
No she had to go to the humane society when my ex boyfriend and I broke up.   I had no choice, and he did it just to hurt me.  Lily would go swimming with me, ride on our boat etc.  When she was just a pup she would sit on my lap as i rode the four wheeler. 	hit:7639_conv:15278_3_587
Oh wow! Thats so sad, I know animals can be like kids to use. I'm so sorry	hit:7639_conv:15278_4_408
He was originally suspended at 17 when he again got got with a little bit of weed.  They have a law here in missouri called 21 and under law.  Automatically get suspended for a year if ur a minor in possession.	hit:7642_conv:15284_1_587
That can ruin a persons life.	hit:7642_conv:15284_2_322
I know it can which is why I was so worried at court.  THe judge looked at him and said son you need to hire you a lawyer.  I  throw people in jail for things like this.	hit:7642_conv:15284_3_587
That is such a mess.	hit:7642_conv:15284_4_322
The best thing happened at work today!	hit:7643_conv:15287_1_599
Tell me more, sounds exciting! 	hit:7643_conv:15287_2_59
Well we have these weekly meetings about our goals and today I was recognized by name in front of everyone for a job well done.	hit:7643_conv:15287_3_599
Good on you! You finally got recognition for your hard work	hit:7643_conv:15287_4_59
Ugh! Tonight was such a bummer.	hit:7649_conv:15298_1_599
Oh no what happened?	hit:7649_conv:15298_2_322
I was going to go to a concert but couldn't get myself to go by myself at the last minute. I feel like I'm going to regret not going.	hit:7649_conv:15298_3_599
What concert was it?	hit:7649_conv:15298_4_322
It was an annual block party we have here with a local lineup of musicians. I really liked the lineup!	hit:7649_conv:15298_5_599
That probably would have been fun.	hit:7649_conv:15298_6_322
The aftermath was awful.  Trash and debris was everywhere and we were homeless.  We lived out in the country and it took some time before red cross came out to do their report and get help to us.	hit:7651_conv:15302_1_587
That sounds terrible. I hope you're okay now.	hit:7651_conv:15302_2_59
I am doing better now but it was really hard times.  We had moved everything up higher as we never expected our whole house to go.  Unfortunately we had all our belongings in the house as well.	hit:7651_conv:15302_3_587
Well all the matters is that no one was hurt. You can buy property again but not lives.	hit:7651_conv:15302_4_59
I ordered a new phone last week, and when the box got here it was empty.	hit:7656_conv:15313_1_339
That is so messed up!	hit:7656_conv:15313_2_322
Yeah, I was pretty upset, especially when they initially refuse to refund my money.	hit:7656_conv:15313_3_339
I would be so angry.	hit:7656_conv:15313_4_322
A few years back I had to bury my dog, who had died at the age of 13.	hit:7660_conv:15320_1_339
Oh wow, What kind of dog was it? I'm so sorry that must've been super hard	hit:7660_conv:15320_2_408
He was a lab.  It broke my heart, to be honest.	hit:7660_conv:15320_3_339
I can imagine. I haven't had an animal die yet but my cat is 13 and I'm dreading the day	hit:7660_conv:15320_4_408
I thought I would never get the chance or opportunity to better my life as well as my childrens.  I cant wait till I get that degree	hit:7664_conv:15329_1_587
That's wonderful that you are pursuing a degree. What is it in?	hit:7664_conv:15329_2_409
I am getting a counseling degree to help abused women.  I feel I would make a good counselor since I  have been in a few abusive relationships myself.	hit:7664_conv:15329_3_587
That is great that you have been able to overcome and do this to help others. You can really make a difference! 	hit:7664_conv:15329_4_409
I saw a video game trailer recently that really brought me back!	hit:7665_conv:15330_1_599
Yeah? Which game was it for?	hit:7665_conv:15330_2_361
The new Spyro Remastered game coming out. Seeing it really reminded me of how I used to play the original all day with an old friend of mine.	hit:7665_conv:15330_3_599
Nice. The original Spyro is a classic.	hit:7665_conv:15330_4_361
I had a flat on the way to work this morning, and the jack handle was missing from my car.	hit:7668_conv:15337_1_339
Oh no. What did you do?	hit:7668_conv:15337_2_413
I used a screwdriver to work the jack. It sucked, lol.	hit:7668_conv:15337_3_339
Lol, well done for attempting it. Did you make it to work on time?	hit:7668_conv:15337_4_413
Yep, with 5 minutes to spare. (No pun intended)	hit:7668_conv:15337_5_339
I just celebrated my birthday and it was so much better than usual.	hit:7674_conv:15349_1_599
That's great. What made it so special this year?	hit:7674_conv:15349_2_361
I usually don't do much to celebrate but this year a friend of mine got all my other friends together to throw a party for me without me knowing. It was a great time.	hit:7674_conv:15349_3_599
Sounds like fun! I'm glad you had a happy birthday.	hit:7674_conv:15349_4_361
My wife and I have tried to have a baby for over three years, and had given up hope.  Two weeks ago, we found out she was pregnant.	hit:7675_conv:15351_1_339
I am so happy for you! Congrats!	hit:7675_conv:15351_2_322
Thank you!  We were both pretty shocked by the news, lol.	hit:7675_conv:15351_3_339
I wish you nothing but the best!	hit:7675_conv:15351_4_322
I was in an extremely dangerous abusive relationship at the time and I knew he was intending to put her in the middle of it all.   He intended to use her for leverage over me .	hit:7677_conv:15355_1_587
It sounds like you're talking about two different people there instead of just one person.  I'm a little confused.	hit:7677_conv:15355_2_244
Oh my I am getting ahead of myself.  I was referring to when I had to put my daughter emerson up for adoption in 2011.  	hit:7677_conv:15355_3_587
Ouch that sucks. I'm sorry to hear that.	hit:7677_conv:15355_4_244
Ugh! My friend is definitely getting on my nerves today.	hit:7680_conv:15361_1_599
Why what happened? Are y'all on a trip?	hit:7680_conv:15361_2_408
We made plans to catch up but never set a time. I tried to contact him to figure out what time and he never got back to me. I was looking forward to catching up.	hit:7680_conv:15361_3_599
Oh wow, so he basically ghosted you? I would be mad too	hit:7680_conv:15361_4_408
Yes, I pray not to be found or trapped like they trapped me to stab unknown man.	hit:7681_conv:15362_1_153
That sounds very bizarre.	hit:7681_conv:15362_2_322
Serious, that has being my worse situation so far	hit:7681_conv:15362_3_153
I hope you are okay.	hit:7681_conv:15362_4_322
My car window was broken when i walked up to my car this morning!	hit:7682_conv:15365_1_567
That is so messed up!	hit:7682_conv:15365_2_322
Yeah it is! Im going to have to spend money I didnt have. Im so upset right now.	hit:7682_conv:15365_3_567
I hope this doesn't happen again.	hit:7682_conv:15365_4_322
I agree. I have never felt this frusterated in a long time! I should go for a walk	hit:7682_conv:15365_5_567
I really felt like a fool last night.	hit:7684_conv:15368_1_599
Oh my, what did you do, may I ask?	hit:7684_conv:15368_2_59
I was playing a board game with a few friends and I ended up spilling my entire drink all over the table. 	hit:7684_conv:15368_3_599
That does not sound good. It must have been so embarrassing!	hit:7684_conv:15368_4_59
Work was not a good experience today.	hit:7688_conv:15377_1_599
Oh no, what happened?	hit:7688_conv:15377_2_322
I had to explain how a bunch of things work in front of a lot of people. I'm not a fan of talking in front of a crowd.	hit:7688_conv:15377_3_599
I hate public speaking too!	hit:7688_conv:15377_4_322
When i moved to dallas I felt I would have the time of my life after living in a small town, but after a couple of weeks i got homesick.	hit:7691_conv:15382_1_567
Dallas is a really fast city.	hit:7691_conv:15382_2_322
yeah it is. I dont know anybody and my classmates all have jobs. so I get to be at home by myself alot	hit:7691_conv:15382_3_567
I'm sorry, things will get better.	hit:7691_conv:15382_4_322
thank you. i wish i havd more friends here. 	hit:7691_conv:15382_5_567
I'm really excited about this weekend!	hit:7693_conv:15387_1_599
What are your plans?	hit:7693_conv:15387_2_408
A friend of mine has been out of the country for a year and he has finally come back. We're going to catch up.	hit:7693_conv:15387_3_599
Thats aweosme! Is he going to be staying with you?	hit:7693_conv:15387_4_408
Yep, we have all weekend to hangout!	hit:7693_conv:15387_5_599
So my sister drove my car to run an errand and got a ticket! She doesnt have her license	hit:7696_conv:15393_1_567
That is terrible. What happened then?	hit:7696_conv:15393_2_7
Well not much. Its just I feel bad because I told her I would take her but got so busy. Maybe im the one that should have got the ticket. not her	hit:7696_conv:15393_3_567
I understand. My mistaske always happened.	hit:7696_conv:15393_4_7
I agree. Its my fault she will have this fine. I will have to pay it for her now . 	hit:7696_conv:15393_5_567
Financial troubles are sometimes the worst! Ugh.	hit:7699_conv:15398_1_599
Those are so stressful. Just take it step by step and you can get on track. 	hit:7699_conv:15398_2_409
You really have to. Luckily, my family was able to help me out and get me back on my feet. It's definitely nice to have people who are willing to help.	hit:7699_conv:15398_3_599
That makes all the difference. I am glad you were able to get out of that position. 	hit:7699_conv:15398_4_409
so my brother will be the first out of 4 kids of my parents to have a baby and today is going to be the gender revealing party. 	hit:7703_conv:15406_1_567
You must be really excited for it! Do you think its going to be girl or boy?	hit:7703_conv:15406_2_59
we all want a boy so we are all cant wait to find out what it is. everyone is so impatient about it, but today is the day.	hit:7703_conv:15406_3_567
Well, it will great either way as long as the baby is healthy! 	hit:7703_conv:15406_4_59

I'm looking forward to how chill this weekend will be.	hit:7706_conv:15412_1_599
Do you plan do something this weekend?	hit:7706_conv:15412_2_7
Quite the opposite, really. I just paid all my bills and have not really any plans. Sometimes it's nice to just not have that stress and relax.	hit:7706_conv:15412_3_599
Yes. It is sometime nice to just rest at home.	hit:7706_conv:15412_4_7
So this year will be the first time I been to a haunted house. Im get scared easilty so Im kinda worried. I promised my friend I would go with her. 	hit:7707_conv:15414_1_567
That sounds like fun Do you know who haunts it?	hit:7707_conv:15414_2_409
I dont know, but I feel I should not go, but again I promised my friend I would go. I dont know wha to do now. 	hit:7707_conv:15414_3_567
Well, if you promised I would try to go. I'm sure it'll be fine. 	hit:7707_conv:15414_4_409
I agree. I will think about it for now. I'm very scared something will happen so im debating. 	hit:7707_conv:15414_5_567
Me and this girl have been dating for awhile now,so I think Im going to ask her to be my girlfriend. 	hit:7711_conv:15423_1_567
Nice! You must be pretty confident she will say yes.	hit:7711_conv:15423_2_59
Yes I agree. I feel that way about it. You know me too well. 	hit:7711_conv:15423_3_567
I hope it goes well for you and brings happiness to you both.	hit:7711_conv:15423_4_59
Thank you. I hope she dont say no, but i can bet you she says yes. 	hit:7711_conv:15423_5_567
My sister's cat got sick and had to be put down last week. Feels bad.	hit:7714_conv:15429_1_549
That sounds terrible. But hopefully it isnt suffering any more. 	hit:7714_conv:15429_2_59
She had stomach cancer, so she was in a lot of pain. Definitely the right thing to do	hit:7714_conv:15429_3_549
I agree, just remember her for all the good memories. 	hit:7714_conv:15429_4_59
I have a huge exam coming up tomorrow.	hit:7715_conv:15430_1_599
Have you been studying? That is intimidating but I bet you'll do great! What's the subject?	hit:7715_conv:15430_2_410
It's for a PC Architecture class. I'm feeling really good about it though since I studied really hard all week!	hit:7715_conv:15430_3_599
What an interesting course! I hope you do really well. Exams can be so scary- they can cause such anxiety. 	hit:7715_conv:15430_4_410
There are maggots all over my building's garbage bin this morning. I got one on my arm when I walked by	hit:7720_conv:15441_1_549
That is very bad. Did you complaint to the landlord?	hit:7720_conv:15441_2_7
They don't care. They live upstairs and are very dirty people. I'm moving as soon as I get a job!	hit:7720_conv:15441_3_549
I understand. The best thing is to move.	hit:7720_conv:15441_4_7
Coming home driving in the rain my car hydroplaned on the freeway!	hit:7726_conv:15453_1_567
That's awful! I'm always scared that's going to happen to me when it's raining	hit:7726_conv:15453_2_458
I agree and thank god I was the only car on the freeway , otherwise It would be a different story!	hit:7726_conv:15453_3_567
You got lucky for sure!  I can't imagine how scary that would be	hit:7726_conv:15453_4_458
Yah im very thankful to be here right now! whew!	hit:7726_conv:15453_5_567
I'm amazed on how many people came to the parade considering the rain!	hit:7728_conv:15456_1_567
Really, where was this parade at? I'm in Missouri and it was absolutely pouring on Friday	hit:7728_conv:15456_2_466
I'm here down south and It has been pouring as well, but that didnt stop people from coming! Im shocked. 	hit:7728_conv:15456_3_567
I usually don't let a little rain stop me unless it's ridiculous!	hit:7728_conv:15456_4_466
I agree! They even brougth their kids! its so baffling!	hit:7728_conv:15456_5_567
I just saw a commercial about the Rescue Animals. Everytime I see it it makes me so sad. 	hit:7735_conv:15471_1_567
oh no. feeling empathy towards them just shows you're normal. There's a lot of people in your boat	hit:7735_conv:15471_2_70
Yea. It reminds me of my old dog that was a rescue. So many memories. I want to go get one actually. 	hit:7735_conv:15471_3_567
whats preventing you?	hit:7735_conv:15471_4_70
I started nursing school and work full time, so I wont give much time to it. I want it to be a happy dog. 	hit:7735_conv:15471_5_567
you sound too kind. You'd be a great dog mother/father!	hit:7735_conv:15471_6_70
Thank you! Im gonna have to not see them commercials anymore, otherwise I will cry 	hit:7735_conv:15471_7_567
I love mystery boxes in games! Unfortunately I usually don't get anything good.	hit:7736_conv:15472_1_549
That sounds fun!  What are they exactly?	hit:7736_conv:15472_2_277
Almost any game that has an online component! Like right now I play The Secret World and it has mystery boxes.	hit:7736_conv:15472_3_549
It sounds like you really enjoy it!  Good for you!	hit:7736_conv:15472_4_277
So I will be going to see my mom after 2 years of not seeing her since starting school! I cant wait	hit:7738_conv:15477_1_567
How exciting! She must be thrilled too	hit:7738_conv:15477_2_397

I hope you guys have the best time!	hit:7738_conv:15477_4_397
Thank you! WE will make the best of it !	hit:7738_conv:15477_5_567
So the role I worked so hard for went to a person who could care less about the play! 	hit:7740_conv:15480_1_567
That unfortunate.  Are you feeling a little jealous?	hit:7740_conv:15480_2_244
I guess you can say that! What a day!	hit:7740_conv:15480_3_567
I hate it when stuff like that happens. 	hit:7740_conv:15480_4_244
I agree. Maybe I will act like him next time. 	hit:7740_conv:15480_5_567
Haha, nooooo... don't do that.   There are too many of those people in the world as it is.	hit:7740_conv:15480_6_244
Yeah your right. I will stick to my little envious rant and go about my day	hit:7740_conv:15480_7_567
Sounds like the best course to me :)	hit:7740_conv:15480_8_244
Once, I went camping with my family. We saw many animals and a beautiful creek. It was a happy time.	hit:7742_conv:15484_1_607
That sounds so great. Being in nature makes you feel so good. 	hit:7742_conv:15484_2_409
It does! I really hope we get to go camping again this fall.	hit:7742_conv:15484_3_607
You should just make a plan and do it. It sounds like it is worthwhile. 	hit:7742_conv:15484_4_409
We order Chinese food last. The order was completely wrong but the lady seemed very helpful when we called.	hit:7745_conv:15490_1_607
That sucks, sorry to hear that. Did you get a refund?	hit:7745_conv:15490_2_466
We didn't get a refund but they were able to fix the order. I was really craving Chinese!	hit:7745_conv:15490_3_607
Hopefully they get your order correct the next time you order there!	hit:7745_conv:15490_4_466
I ate a lot of my kid's Halloween candy. I told her the candy was old and I had to throw it away.	hit:7749_conv:15498_1_607
Did it taste good?	hit:7749_conv:15498_2_409
It was really good! She had a lot of candy. I was hoping she wouldn't notice some missing!	hit:7749_conv:15498_3_607
Did it taste good?	hit:7749_conv:15498_4_409
Yes it did!	hit:7749_conv:15498_5_607
two weeks back i celebrated my birthday and do you know what my office colleagues planed for me	hit:7752_conv:15504_1_355

yes and i am quiet happy that they also brought my wife who stays in london for party to surprise me	hit:7752_conv:15504_3_355

You must have great co workers. I bet your happy everyday you go to work	hit:7752_conv:15504_6_567
So my childhood dog died last week. My mother called me with the news. 	hit:7752_conv:15505_1_567
oh so sad , what happened to it	hit:7752_conv:15505_2_355
He died of old age. He could barely walk so they put him down. Yeah pretty bad news. It made my day blue	hit:7752_conv:15505_3_567
it must must a very much hard time for you and your family 	hit:7752_conv:15505_4_355

yes , he be rest in peace	hit:7752_conv:15505_6_355
We went camping in the mountain. We did not know it was bear season. There were a lot of hunters and hunting dogs in the area. They were chasing the bears into one area	hit:7754_conv:15509_1_607
I would be so scared. I think I might have to leave. Did the bears bother anyone?	hit:7754_conv:15509_2_49
Luckily, the hunters kept them around a mile from camp. It was still very hard to sleep! We heard dogs barking at the bears all night!	hit:7754_conv:15509_3_607
Were you in a tent or a camper? I hope you kept your food locked up tightly.	hit:7754_conv:15509_4_49
We were in a tent and all of food was in a Yeti! I made sure everyone put their food away and burned leftovers in the fire.	hit:7754_conv:15509_5_607
Glad everyone is safe! You were very smart.	hit:7754_conv:15509_6_49
We had a doberman for over 8 years. He passed away last spring. It was a hard time for our family.	hit:7757_conv:15514_1_607
Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that. I know pets can be like one of the family. 	hit:7757_conv:15514_2_409
They are like having another child! I hope to have another doberman one day. They're really good dogs.	hit:7757_conv:15514_3_607
You should adopt a rescue dog. That would be great for the family. 	hit:7757_conv:15514_4_409
That's a great idea!	hit:7757_conv:15514_5_607
last week i visited a restaurant and found a insect in the burger which i ordered	hit:7759_conv:15519_1_355
That's disgusting. What did you do about it?	hit:7759_conv:15519_2_466
i immediately raised an alarm about the issue and complained to store manager	hit:7759_conv:15519_3_355
Did you get a refund at least? I would never visit that restaurant ever again if I were you!	hit:7759_conv:15519_4_466
yes they provided me a 100 dollar gift card too	hit:7759_conv:15519_5_355
We have homeschooled our daughter for the past 3 years. This year, she has decided to return to public school.	hit:7760_conv:15520_1_607
That's interesting! Most kids love being home-schooled but I guess she missed socializing and interacting with her peers.	hit:7760_conv:15520_2_442
She did miss having a lot of friends. I hope she does well. She starts in 10 days!	hit:7760_conv:15520_3_607
Not too much longer! I hope she adjusts well and enjoys herself. Public school can still provide an enriching experience when it comes to social skills and education.	hit:7760_conv:15520_4_442
This will be my last semester in college! I cant wait to finish.	hit:7762_conv:15525_1_567
Wow good job! SO close	hit:7762_conv:15525_2_397
THanks!. I get so happy everytime I think about it!	hit:7762_conv:15525_3_567
Thats a great accomplishment	hit:7762_conv:15525_4_397
I agree. My family will be proud of me! 	hit:7762_conv:15525_5_567
Since I moved to dallas I have not met any friends. I go to work and school and just come home. 	hit:7764_conv:15529_1_567
maybe you should job a club or a social gatherings group	hit:7764_conv:15529_2_463
I agree. It gets boring at home alone with no one. 	hit:7764_conv:15529_3_567
i agree. you need to socialize a little bit to get out of your lonely slump	hit:7764_conv:15529_4_463
I agree. This weekend it is! 	hit:7764_conv:15529_5_567
that should be fun. good luck!	hit:7764_conv:15529_6_463
My sister lives in Utah. We had planned for her to come visit but her work would not allow her to take the time off.	hit:7766_conv:15533_1_607
Aw that's annoying. Work always gets in the way of things. Did you ever try to go to her?	hit:7766_conv:15533_2_234
I haven't yet. I would like to eventually. I'm hoping to see her soon	hit:7766_conv:15533_3_607
I'm sure it will work out! Not this time unfortunatly, but it will in the end	hit:7766_conv:15533_4_234
So I was out of town this weekend and lent my brother my car. I was hesitant at first, but I felt he would do good with it and take care of it. 	hit:7768_conv:15537_1_567
Did he take care of it for you?	hit:7768_conv:15537_2_409
He did. I feel I can let him use it more often after this. 	hit:7768_conv:15537_3_567
That is great that he was able to show you he is responsible. I bet you're proud. 	hit:7768_conv:15537_4_409
Yes I am. I can know rest assure that he will do good. 	hit:7768_conv:15537_5_567
My husband works very hard so that I can be a stay at home mom. It has allowed me the freedom to homeschool our daughter.	hit:7769_conv:15538_1_607
That's awesome, what does your hubster do?	hit:7769_conv:15538_2_466
He owns an auto repair shop. He works from sun up to sun down!	hit:7769_conv:15538_3_607
Wow, I admire his dedication! And you won't ever have to worry about your vehicle breaking!	hit:7769_conv:15538_4_466
That's is the number one perk of having a mechanic for a husband!	hit:7769_conv:15538_5_607
So my 1 year review at work is coming up and I feel its going to be good since I wokred so hard. 	hit:7771_conv:15543_1_567
Hard work pays off in the long-run. If your work is truly authentic in its nature, it is definitely going to be recognized and appreciated	hit:7771_conv:15543_2_155
I agree. I think my raise will be good as well as the promotion I asked for. 	hit:7771_conv:15543_3_567
Be careful while negotiating your pay raise. Some managers may find it too intrusive and that may leave bad impression on them	hit:7771_conv:15543_4_155
Sounds like a plan! She has noticed my work , so im confident it will work out well. 	hit:7771_conv:15543_5_567
My child sneaked in my room to get the Xbox controller while I was sleeping. The night before, I had grounded her.	hit:7772_conv:15545_1_607
Oh no, do you think she was trying to get back at you for grounding her?	hit:7772_conv:15545_2_609
I think she thought she could play a few minutes of Minecraft and then return the controller before I woke up! I caught her getting into the drawer where I hid it.	hit:7772_conv:15545_3_607
I definitely remember trying something like that when I was a kid.  I think sometimes kids think they're sneakier than they actually are.	hit:7772_conv:15545_4_609
My friend came to my house drunk and threw up everywhere. 	hit:7778_conv:15556_1_567
Whow!  That sounds really disgusting!  What did you do?	hit:7778_conv:15556_2_277
Yes it was! I could not do nothing. She was in a raging fit. Ijust made she she went to sleep ok. 	hit:7778_conv:15556_3_567
Man, you are a good friend!  I would have been beyond angry!	hit:7778_conv:15556_4_277
I am! I'm more grossed out about it than anything!	hit:7778_conv:15556_5_567
My friends mother got diagnosed with cancer last month and its been hard on her. 	hit:7782_conv:15564_1_567
So sorry to hear that. It is truly horrifying and i wish and hope for nobody to be hit with this calamity	hit:7782_conv:15564_2_155
Yeah. Shes my best friend, so I'm planning to go with her this weekend to see her mom. my heart breaks for her..	hit:7782_conv:15564_3_567
Indeed. Friends should be together in times of need. That is what friends are for	hit:7782_conv:15564_4_155
I agree! Thank you!	hit:7782_conv:15564_5_567
Last week I did a presentation at work and as I stood up I blew some gas!	hit:7783_conv:15566_1_567
oh no!! Did anyone notice? it's normal though, we all do that sometimes	hit:7783_conv:15566_2_52
Yes it was loud. I can feel my face turn red and the room getting quiet!	hit:7783_conv:15566_3_567
oh man... It happened to me before, i know how embarrassing it is.	hit:7783_conv:15566_4_52
Yes it was. Ugh!	hit:7783_conv:15566_5_567
So my little brother barely passed his finals to become a cop! I could not beleive it. 	hit:7784_conv:15569_1_567
That's great that he passed though!  ARe you happy about it?	hit:7784_conv:15569_2_56
Im very happy, but all he do through school was party and never study. Im shocked. 	hit:7784_conv:15569_3_567
Well at least he passed - that's great!	hit:7784_conv:15569_4_56
Yes it is. Im happy for him.!	hit:7784_conv:15569_5_567
We went to the library where they had an animal expert stop by for the kids. My daughter was able to answer most of his questions that other kids could not. It made me smile.	hit:7789_conv:15578_1_607
That is pretty neat actually. I wish i had kids to bring to stuff like that.	hit:7789_conv:15578_2_9
You should check your local library. The ones in my area have tons of things, like a Lego club, for the local kids.	hit:7789_conv:15578_3_607
I will do that, i had no idea.	hit:7789_conv:15578_4_9
My dad died of cancer in 2012. That was really hard for me emotionally.	hit:7798_conv:15597_1_573
I'm really sorry to hear that.	hit:7798_conv:15597_2_53
Thank you. I was prepared, but it was still difficult.	hit:7798_conv:15597_3_573
I can't even imagine to be honest.	hit:7798_conv:15597_4_53
I hope you don't have to go through it for a long time.	hit:7798_conv:15597_5_573
I have lost grandparents and greatparents but they were all older in age so it was easier to deal with.	hit:7798_conv:15597_6_53
It's always tough, even if someone is older.	hit:7798_conv:15597_7_573
I'm sure it will be different when it's a parent.	hit:7798_conv:15597_8_53
I have a performance review and potential promotion coming up in the next few weeks.	hit:7813_conv:15627_1_607
that's awesome! I hope you will get a promotion. what do you do for work?	hit:7813_conv:15627_2_50
I work as an accountant for a carpet cleaning company. There is a chance that I could be made a manager!	hit:7813_conv:15627_3_607
You will be a great manager! Good luck with everythig	hit:7813_conv:15627_4_50
I just hired a new hotel inspector, he has very little experience but wants to learn. Scares me.	hit:7827_conv:15654_1_60
you took a risk huh? i hope he will be a great worker! That's good you gave him a chance	hit:7827_conv:15654_2_50
Yes, I need more staff member and he was very nice. But if he does a bad job I get fired.	hit:7827_conv:15654_3_60
i hope it won't happen! 	hit:7827_conv:15654_4_50
In high school, I fell down the stairs in front of my crush. My face turned red and I ran away!	hit:7828_conv:15656_1_607
Oh no! Did he say anything about it?	hit:7828_conv:15656_2_343
He laughed at me. Looking back, I'm sure it was funny but in the moment, I could have died!	hit:7828_conv:15656_3_607
I know what you mean. I've done stuff like that too - you do feel a bit silly, don't you!	hit:7828_conv:15656_4_343
Last night I won a gift card at Trivia night at the pub. Going shopping today.	hit:7836_conv:15672_1_60
Awesome! What are you planning on buying?	hit:7836_conv:15672_2_448
I've got a baby due in December so something for the baby or my wife. I never bother getting my self anything.	hit:7836_conv:15672_3_60
Maybe you can figure out a way to get all three of you guys something!	hit:7836_conv:15672_4_448
I found out my wife was dating someone else a year before we got married, we were together for 7 years at that point. Today I'm stressed!	hit:7838_conv:15677_1_60
Oh no that is crazy!	hit:7838_conv:15677_2_99
Yea, We have a baby due in December so I'm trying to not jump to any decisions to quickly.	hit:7838_conv:15677_3_60
Well I'm sorry you are going through this and I hope you can figure it all out. 	hit:7838_conv:15677_4_99
Thanks, everything happens for a reason. 	hit:7838_conv:15677_5_60
I woke up one morning to make a sandwich. The smell of the sandwich meat made me sick! I felt something was wrong and drove to the nearest store. I purchased a pregnancy test.	hit:7839_conv:15678_1_607
I hate those things, i try to not eat those at all.	hit:7839_conv:15678_2_9
I usually love eating sandwiches which is why I knew something just wasn't right! I was experiencing morning sickness!	hit:7839_conv:15678_3_607
I eat steak and shrimp.	hit:7839_conv:15678_4_9
I have a friend that will not stop talking about himself. He always wants to talk about his latest investments, the books he has read, and how much he knows about the places that he visits!	hit:7853_conv:15707_1_607
i really dislike snooty people who are constantly rubbing their amazing life in your face.	hit:7853_conv:15707_2_463
I do too. It makes me not want to be around those types of people.	hit:7853_conv:15707_3_607
i wouldn't be friends with someone like that. i mean what can you benefit from that friendship?	hit:7853_conv:15707_4_463
Exactly! I should really stop hanging out with him.	hit:7853_conv:15707_5_607
agreed. you really won't be missing out on anything worthwhile.	hit:7853_conv:15707_6_463
I am a big Taylor Swift friend! 	hit:7857_conv:15715_1_147
I love Taylor Swift! She's talented and beautiful!	hit:7857_conv:15715_2_99
Yes I need to arrive at her concert tonight at  8!	hit:7857_conv:15715_3_147
How exciting for you! Have fun!	hit:7857_conv:15715_4_99
I know I studied well, but I can't stop worrying about it. 	hit:7859_conv:15718_1_147
You have a test coming up?	hit:7859_conv:15718_2_99
Yes on Friday. It is the final.	hit:7859_conv:15718_3_147
Well I hope you do well! Good luck.	hit:7859_conv:15718_4_99
She had a lot  of friends that came.	hit:7866_conv:15733_1_147
That's interesting. What was she doing?	hit:7866_conv:15733_2_478
She had her birthday at Chuck E Cheese.	hit:7866_conv:15733_3_147
That's awesome! I didn't know that place was still in business. 	hit:7866_conv:15733_4_478
I love to coupon but sometimes I feel like the cashiers aren't trained properly. They will look at the coupon for every detail and do not understand the language in the fine print.	hit:7867_conv:15734_1_607
Yeah I bet it is frustrating. The store gets reimbursed for the coupons so they should not nitpick.	hit:7867_conv:15734_2_139
I agree. It's not like the money will come out of their paycheck if something is wrong!	hit:7867_conv:15734_3_607
I hope they get better training so you don't have to argue with them about it	hit:7867_conv:15734_4_139
The cop said he was too old!	hit:7869_conv:15738_1_147
Too old for what? What a strange thing to say.	hit:7869_conv:15738_2_139
Too old to give him a ticket for reckless driving! 	hit:7869_conv:15738_3_147
That doesn't make much sense. Maybe I am missing the context.	hit:7869_conv:15738_4_139
That's what I thought! 	hit:7869_conv:15738_5_147
I played a game of poker with a friend who had no idea what he was doing. I won about $100 from him that night.	hit:7871_conv:15743_1_607
Oh no, he shouldn't have gambled. 	hit:7871_conv:15743_2_356
You are probably right! I felt bad when I was spending the money. I hope he didn't really need it.	hit:7871_conv:15743_3_607
I would've too, but sometimes people need to learn a lesson.	hit:7871_conv:15743_4_356
This is very true!	hit:7871_conv:15743_5_607
Recently there have been a few break ins.	hit:7879_conv:15758_1_147
Oh no! Did you property get broken into? Or your neighbor's property?	hit:7879_conv:15758_2_356
No, my neighbor did but that's close enough for me! 	hit:7879_conv:15758_3_147
For real! Are you taking any precautions?	hit:7879_conv:15758_4_356
One time I saw a stray dog walking around a restaurant looking for food	hit:7880_conv:15760_1_547
Inside the restaurant ? What kind of place was this ?	hit:7880_conv:15760_2_225
It was outside a fried chicken chain restaurant	hit:7880_conv:15760_3_547
Okay, that makes more sense then to me.	hit:7880_conv:15760_4_225
We made sure to board up for the hurricane coming.	hit:7883_conv:15766_1_147
Where are you located ?	hit:7883_conv:15766_2_225
We are in Miami, Florida 1 mile from the beach. .	hit:7883_conv:15766_3_147
I wasn't even aware there was a hurricane.	hit:7883_conv:15766_4_225
The cop said I will probably never find out who did it. 	hit:7889_conv:15778_1_147
Who did what?	hit:7889_conv:15778_2_99
I wont find out who the person was that hit my car while I was sleeping.	hit:7889_conv:15778_3_147
Oh I'm so sorry to hear that. People are so inconsiderate!	hit:7889_conv:15778_4_99
My sons teacher isn't very nice to the young kindergartners. 	hit:7891_conv:15783_1_147
Oh no! Why not?!	hit:7891_conv:15783_2_99
Not, sure, but she is not very nice at all.	hit:7891_conv:15783_3_147
I would make a complaint to the principal if I were you!	hit:7891_conv:15783_4_99
I may never know who she was.	hit:7893_conv:15786_1_147
Never know who was?	hit:7893_conv:15786_2_478
The women that hit my car and left before the police came.	hit:7893_conv:15786_3_147
Wow that is aweful! 	hit:7893_conv:15786_4_478
I agree. And the cop said I will probably have to pay for my own damage! 	hit:7893_conv:15786_5_147
Near my house, there is an abandoned school that is said to be haunted. When I was a teenager, a group of friends and I decided to go check it out.	hit:7897_conv:15795_1_607
Oh wow, what happened?	hit:7897_conv:15795_2_343
When we pulled up, it was very spooky. I didn't even want to get out of the car! A few of my friends tried to get in but it was boarded up. I looked in the window and there was still writing on the chalkboards!	hit:7897_conv:15795_3_607
That would give me the creeps! Has anyone seen anything there?	hit:7897_conv:15795_4_343
There are stories about ghosts of children walking through the hallways and that you can hear laughing. We didn't see or hear anything supernatural but it was still scary!	hit:7897_conv:15795_5_607
I bet it was. I've only had one creepy experience - that was in an old house in West Virginia. I'm very careful to avoid those places these days!	hit:7897_conv:15795_6_343
My hair has always been long and I had been scared to have a short hair cut. Last December, I finally took the plunge and cut off all of my hair.	hit:7902_conv:15805_1_607
Good for you! There is nothing wrong or uncool about short hair.	hit:7902_conv:15805_2_478
That's what I have discovered! I get a lot of compliments on it and I feel really good about myself when I go out!	hit:7902_conv:15805_3_607
Great! I'm glad that it worked out well for you!	hit:7902_conv:15805_4_478
I recently drove back to my hometown and went to the towns fair, it felt so nice reliving my childhood.	hit:7928_conv:15856_1_614
That's awesome, I went to visit my parents and my hometown last month, it is a great feeling.  How was the fair?	hit:7928_conv:15856_2_448
It was great, it didn't change much but it still has that 'soul' to it. Just felt great looking at it honestly.	hit:7928_conv:15856_3_614
Brings back all the memories you had as a kid.  I miss going to the state fair, was always fun.	hit:7928_conv:15856_4_448
When I was in high school, I dated a guy for almost a year. A few weeks before summer, he broke up with me and started seeing another girl.	hit:7930_conv:15860_1_607
You must have been sad and angry.	hit:7930_conv:15860_2_203
I was. I would get really mad when I saw them at lunch or after school together. I was my first experience with heart break.	hit:7930_conv:15860_3_607
Yes first heart brake is so hard, I feel for you, something similar happened to me with my first boyfriend.	hit:7930_conv:15860_4_203
This was my first time winning a contest on the raido!	hit:7935_conv:15871_1_147
That's awesome! Congratulations!	hit:7935_conv:15871_2_397
Thanks! I will get to go free to the Taylor Swift concert tonight! 	hit:7935_conv:15871_3_147
No way! That's actually a super awesome prize! Have fun	hit:7935_conv:15871_4_397
I bought extra items during school lunch in high school. I have a negative balance on my account.	hit:7939_conv:15878_1_607
Ouch, hopefully its not by much. I remember when i was in high school i had a similar situation. They're usually pretty lenient on it.	hit:7939_conv:15878_2_614
I had to take money out of my dad's wallet to cover it. I would have got in so much trouble with my parents for buying candy! It wasn't much but I still felt bad.	hit:7939_conv:15878_3_607
I'm sure your dad wouldn't mind haha, its usually pretty cheap anything i remember they cost like $1.	hit:7939_conv:15878_4_614
I had a roommate in my dorm who didn't clean up his dorm room at the end of the semester and the school fined me and the other two roommates $100. I was furious at that guy.	hit:7939_conv:15879_1_614
Did you try to get the money from him? He sounds like a pretty bad person.	hit:7939_conv:15879_2_607
Yeah we tried but he cut all communication, he didn't respond to his phone number or anything. I hope he got fined a larger amount so it teaches him a lesson on laziness. 	hit:7939_conv:15879_3_614
I do too! People like that make me never want to have a roommate! 	hit:7939_conv:15879_4_607
So i recently traveled to Cuba to see some friends and we went to a bar until 3 AM, and as we were walking back there were these 3 guys hiding in the shadows. We got so scared we started running but thankfully they didn't follow.	hit:7946_conv:15892_1_614
Oh wow. That's pretty scary. I would be horrified.	hit:7946_conv:15892_2_356
Yeah it was quite an experience, my friends said those are usually drunk people who stay up the whole night talking with people. But they looked like they wanted to do more than talk!	hit:7946_conv:15892_3_614
Well, at least they didn't follow you. How is Cuba? My parents are from there but I've never been.	hit:7946_conv:15892_4_356
Its great, very beautiful and amazing culture (and food!). Just don't drive if you go, they seriously drive like maniacs haha	hit:7946_conv:15892_5_614
I raised 6 chickens since they were babies. I was trying to let them free range but I forgot to put them back in their coop for the night. A predator was able to get to them.	hit:7947_conv:15895_1_607
Oh no! That's sad, did he get them all?	hit:7947_conv:15895_2_448
Yes, it did! I think it was a dog that always gets out of our neighbor's yard.	hit:7947_conv:15895_3_607
Aw, that's too bad, hopefully next time they will be safe in the coop!	hit:7947_conv:15895_4_448
I was looking through old clothes that i was giving away and found $40 in one of the back pockets. Made me very happy lol	hit:7953_conv:15907_1_614
wow, so what are you going to do with it?	hit:7953_conv:15907_2_612
Oh i just put it into a little piggy bank i have, trying to get to $220 to cop some yeezys that are coming out in october. Hope i get a pair!	hit:7953_conv:15907_3_614
nice, i hope that works out for you... good luck	hit:7953_conv:15907_4_612
I was watching youtube and saw this guy eat a jellyfish straight out of the ocean. Looked like the most disgusting thing someone could eat.	hit:7957_conv:15915_1_614
That is gross, I can't even imagine what that would taste like!	hit:7957_conv:15915_2_448
He said it had the texture of hard rubber and tasted of pure algae and just dead stuff. He even ate another one that he pan-fried and it was all green and moldy.	hit:7957_conv:15915_3_614
That's so gross, I would take a hard pass on eating that. I like seafood but that's too much.	hit:7957_conv:15915_4_448
One of my friends jumped from the roof of his house to the pool and somehow made it, it was like 10+ feet of distance, really amazing stuff.	hit:7961_conv:15922_1_614
Omg, Thankfully he wasn't hurt. 	hit:7961_conv:15922_2_147
Yeah i was really nervous that he was gonna get hurt since he likes to do stupid dares. It was quite the experience.	hit:7961_conv:15922_3_614
Did yall happen to get it on video? 	hit:7961_conv:15922_4_147
No sadly, nobody had their phones with them at the moment. But theres plenty of videos on youtube showing what happens if you dont make it!	hit:7961_conv:15922_5_614
My older brother is getting married Friday.	hit:7961_conv:15923_1_147
Congrats!, I'm sure you must be very happy!	hit:7961_conv:15923_2_614
I am very happy for him! I thought it was never going to happen!	hit:7961_conv:15923_3_147
Haha brotherly love, I hope him and the lucky gal have a wonderful life together!	hit:7961_conv:15923_4_614
Having a kid can be one of the most happy moments in a person's life. I cannot express how much happiness my daughter has brought to us since she was born.	hit:7963_conv:15926_1_607
thats amazing i cant wait to have my own one day	hit:7963_conv:15926_2_44
It can be hard but it's one of the best experiences that I have had in life.	hit:7963_conv:15926_3_607
i bet so!	hit:7963_conv:15926_4_44
im nervous for the new week to begin	hit:7963_conv:15927_1_44
Is there something that is making you nervous about the upcoming week?	hit:7963_conv:15927_2_607
very busy and lots of traveling	hit:7963_conv:15927_3_44
That can be stressful. I am sure that every thing with go smoothly for you! Just remember that the weekend is only 5 days away! 	hit:7963_conv:15927_4_607
I spent 10 minutes looking for my car keys while my friends waited outside and they were in my pockets the whole time. My friends made sure i never forgot that moment haha	hit:7964_conv:15928_1_614
We all do stuff like that. At least you didn't lock them inside your car. Done that before!	hit:7964_conv:15928_2_139
Oh thankfully i've never had to go through that yet. That one would really suck!	hit:7964_conv:15928_3_614
Yeah nothing like calling the locksmith and admitting you are not very bright. Haha.	hit:7964_conv:15928_4_139
I told her I had to work because I didn't want to go see a movie tonight.	hit:7966_conv:15933_1_147
Did you not want to go out, or did you just not like the movie?	hit:7966_conv:15933_2_385
I was tired and wanted to get in bed early,	hit:7966_conv:15933_3_147
Just be careful with that. If you feel tired due to stress, it may be the stress talking and not you.	hit:7966_conv:15933_4_385
Had my finals last week, studied really hard for them. Felt so nice walking into that room so confident and calm	hit:7969_conv:15938_1_614
Great, when will you know your scores?	hit:7969_conv:15938_2_572
Thankfully i knew them right at the spot, i got a 98!	hit:7969_conv:15938_3_614
Wow, that's fantastic.	hit:7969_conv:15938_4_572
He doesn;t seem to see the issue.	hit:7970_conv:15941_1_147
Who doesn't?	hit:7970_conv:15941_2_478
My husband doesn't see flirting with girls a problem. 	hit:7970_conv:15941_3_147
What a jerk! That is definitely a problem!	hit:7970_conv:15941_4_478
I studied all week for my math finals and only scraped a 68 on it.	hit:7976_conv:15952_1_614
That's a real bummer. Do you at least pass the class?	hit:7976_conv:15952_2_139
Yeah, passed with a 75, not what i wanted but at least i passed	hit:7976_conv:15952_3_614
Well at least you don't have to take it again. Could have been worse.	hit:7976_conv:15952_4_139
i dropped my groceries in the parking lot	hit:7978_conv:15956_1_44
Oh no, how awful for you! I hope people helped you to pick them up (and didn't help themselves!).	hit:7978_conv:15956_2_343
i grabbed the cans that rolled away, lol	hit:7978_conv:15956_3_44
Glad you find humor in it! I dropped a bottle of water once, which rolled under the car. I was livid!	hit:7978_conv:15956_4_343
One of my roommates left without cleaning his room and the school charged me and my roommates 100$ each	hit:7980_conv:15961_1_614
That's extremely frustrating! What were they expecting you to do? It's not your fault your roommate left it trashed.	hit:7980_conv:15961_2_545
Yeah thats what we told them but they showed us the paper saying that its one of the rules. We were so furious at that guy, worst thing is he never responded to our calls or texts. Really immature and selfish of him.	hit:7980_conv:15961_3_614
Well, I guess the good news is that he no longer lives with you. But that blows, how hard is it to clean up after yourself before you leave?	hit:7980_conv:15961_4_545
"A restaurant that I wanted to eat at had ""call ahead seating"" where you can call and get placed on a waiting list. I called ahead and was told we would have a table in 10 minutes. When we arrived 10 minutes later, our table was not ready!"	hit:7981_conv:15962_1_607
That is so annoying. They should not call it that if they can't guarantee 10 minutes.	hit:7981_conv:15962_2_139
That's what I told the hostess. There was no point in calling ahead if we still have to wait 45 minutes for a table.	hit:7981_conv:15962_3_607
Hopefully the food was at least worth the wait. I would have been annoyed as well.	hit:7981_conv:15962_4_139
The food made it worth the wait, for sure! Any other restaurant I would have walked out!	hit:7981_conv:15962_5_607
We had a new puppy. He loved to chew on everything. I went to the grocery store and when I got back home, the puppy had pulled the cushions off of the couch. He had chewed through the bottom!!	hit:7986_conv:15973_1_607
Oh god! I haven't had a puppy in a long time, but you forget all the things in your house that are not puppy-proof. They find ways to make messes in the most creative ways.	hit:7986_conv:15973_2_545
They do! I'm really glad that that stage didn't last too long in him. I just hated having to buy an entire new living room suite! Puppies are expensive.	hit:7986_conv:15973_3_607
Yeah, that's a real headache. I'd want to say they're worth it, but on that day I wouldn't be so sure, haha.	hit:7986_conv:15973_4_545
I accidentally dropped my phone at the screen started to glitch out and didn't want to turn on anymore. I was scared because it was a brand new phone. Thankfully after a while of it just sitting there it turned back on normally.	hit:7987_conv:15975_1_614
That is a huge blessing, I don't know about you but my life is pretty much keyed into my phone.	hit:7987_conv:15975_2_56
Same here, they're so incredibly important in this day and age.	hit:7987_conv:15975_3_614
It's almost a shame how much we depend on them, but I know I'd be lost without mine.	hit:7987_conv:15975_4_56
i am bothered by my neighbors loud power tools next door	hit:7991_conv:15983_1_44
Do they run them all day long - or at night?	hit:7991_conv:15983_2_56
during the morning and day on the weekends!	hit:7991_conv:15983_3_44
Is there any kind of noise ordinance in your area?  I know in ours unless they are still running them at 11pm, there is nothing the police will/can do about it unfortunately - but I can imagine how annoying it is.	hit:7991_conv:15983_4_56
My best friends invited me to a camping trip but I was a little anxious about the whole thing.	hit:7996_conv:15992_1_580
I don't blame  you because I hate camping.	hit:7996_conv:15992_2_243
Really? I was just really scared of getting bitten by a tick. I ended up enjoying the trip in the end!	hit:7996_conv:15992_3_580
Oh I hate ticks and all the bugs.	hit:7996_conv:15992_4_243
i was blown away by how great my friends were this weekend	hit:7998_conv:15997_1_44
What happened?	hit:7998_conv:15997_2_203
they were very supportive and kind , helping me with some moving things	hit:7998_conv:15997_3_44
You are lucky to have such great friends!	hit:7998_conv:15997_4_203
A few weeks ago I was drinking with some friends at a park and I sliced my hand open while trying to rip a beer can in two.	hit:8002_conv:16004_1_580
oh that sucks, i hope it has healed since then	hit:8002_conv:16004_2_44
It has! The cut was so deep and I was bleeding so much I was scared of passing out from blood loss.	hit:8002_conv:16004_3_580
ouch, that sounds awful	hit:8002_conv:16004_4_44
Moral of the story: don't rip open cans with your hands!	hit:8002_conv:16004_5_580
i was shocked how nice the weather was this morning	hit:8002_conv:16005_1_44
How come? Have you had awful weather lately?	hit:8002_conv:16005_2_580
not really but it was just especially nice this morning	hit:8002_conv:16005_3_44
Oh I see. Beautiful weather is an excellent start to the day!	hit:8002_conv:16005_4_580
I decided to move to be with my boyfriend.	hit:8004_conv:16009_1_13
Oh? Big decision. I hope you feel good about it!	hit:8004_conv:16009_2_234
I did, but I had to leave all my family behind	hit:8004_conv:16009_3_13
Aw, but they'll always be there for you when you visit. You have to do what you want to in life, after all	hit:8004_conv:16009_4_234
im mad at my neighbor today	hit:8008_conv:16016_1_44
Oh that sucks! What did your neighbor do to get you angry?	hit:8008_conv:16016_2_580
he was using powertools loud in the morning	hit:8008_conv:16016_3_44
How inconsiderate. People should have more common sense than your neighbor.	hit:8008_conv:16016_4_580
Last Christmas, I saved up a lot of money and was able to buy my family and girlfriend really nice gifts.	hit:8008_conv:16017_1_580
thats awesome, i always loved giving gifts more than receiving them	hit:8008_conv:16017_2_44
Me too! The act of giving makes me feel so warm and happy.	hit:8008_conv:16017_3_580
me too!	hit:8008_conv:16017_4_44
The teacher I had for Calculus 2 last semester was so terrible at his job, I had to learn it all on my own.	hit:8011_conv:16022_1_580
I hate when I get teachers that are clueless. Makes you wonder how they got the job.	hit:8011_conv:16022_2_139
Same here. Surprisingly, I was able to pass the course and I felt so good about myself!	hit:8011_conv:16022_3_580
Well done. You should feel proud for teaching yourself.	hit:8011_conv:16022_4_139
i felt happy this morning because it was sunny and warm	hit:8013_conv:16026_1_44
That's always a great start to a day.	hit:8013_conv:16026_2_385
absolutely, i was overjoyed	hit:8013_conv:16026_3_44
How are you celebrating it?	hit:8013_conv:16026_4_385
I have a big exam coming up tomorrow.	hit:8015_conv:16030_1_599
Oh wow. What's the exam on?	hit:8015_conv:16030_2_209
It's on PC Architecture. I'm feeling pretty good about it though. I studied really hard all week.	hit:8015_conv:16030_3_599
That's really great. I am sure you will do well on the test.	hit:8015_conv:16030_4_209
On my way back from a funeral, my friends and I almost got into a deadly car crash.	hit:8016_conv:16032_1_580
Oh no, what happened?	hit:8016_conv:16032_2_13
I think the other driver was falling asleep on the road. Out of nowhere, he moved onto the wrong lane directly towards us.	hit:8016_conv:16032_3_580
Well that is really lucky you were able to avoid that. Hopefully he didn't hurt anyone else.	hit:8016_conv:16032_4_13
Agreed. I was so scared we could have been the ones in a casket that night.	hit:8016_conv:16032_5_580
I was so happy that after many years in retail I found a better job.	hit:8016_conv:16033_1_13
Congratulations! Retail really does suck.	hit:8016_conv:16033_2_580
Yeah it does. It really made me dislike people a lot.	hit:8016_conv:16033_3_13
Understandably. My girlfriend is a student and works in retail part-time. She says the same thing.	hit:8016_conv:16033_4_580
Do you ever hear an album and it brings you back to when you first listened to it?	hit:8019_conv:16039_1_599
Oh, all the time. What album is that for you?	hit:8019_conv:16039_2_209
I just listened to a Billy Talent album again the other day and it brought me back to high school and reminded me of the person who showed me them.	hit:8019_conv:16039_3_599
I really love that album! We will have to listen to it together sometime.	hit:8019_conv:16039_4_209
A while back, my older sister stole my younger brother's iPod touch to sell.	hit:8020_conv:16041_1_580
That sucks. Did she make a lot of money off of it?	hit:8020_conv:16041_2_209
No idea. All I know is that I was furious, especially seeing as my brother is the sweetest most innocent kid ever.	hit:8020_conv:16041_3_580
I would've been very angry too. I hope the money went towards something useful.	hit:8020_conv:16041_4_209
Last night was quite a bummer.	hit:8023_conv:16046_1_599
I am sorry to hear that. Why was it a bummer?	hit:8023_conv:16046_2_209
I was planning on going to a concert but ended up not going at the last minute because I didn't want to go by myself. I feel like I'm going to regret not going.	hit:8023_conv:16046_3_599
That really stinks. I bet you felt really lonely and filled my regret.	hit:8023_conv:16046_4_209
After working for a week straight and running a lot of errands, today is my first day off in a while.	hit:8026_conv:16052_1_580
That must feel very refreshing. Would you say you feel content?	hit:8026_conv:16052_2_209
It is, I'm super happy. Currently playing some Zelda on the Switch, it couldn't get any better than this!	hit:8026_conv:16052_3_580
Nice! I want to get that game next week. Looks really cool.	hit:8026_conv:16052_4_209
I highly recommend it. I can't put it down.	hit:8026_conv:16052_5_580
My older brother always makes promises he can't keep.	hit:8030_conv:16061_1_580
That is disappointing. I wonder why he's like that.	hit:8030_conv:16061_2_99
I don't know why. Recently we were supposed to go out for sushi lunch together, but he keeps postponing it. I'll ask him for a definitive day.	hit:8030_conv:16061_3_580
I hope he doesn't let you down.	hit:8030_conv:16061_4_99
I'm so happy for my brother!	hit:8031_conv:16062_1_599
Something good happen to him recently?	hit:8031_conv:16062_2_286
He just graduated from college. He put in so much work.	hit:8031_conv:16062_3_599
That's amazing! Tell him congratulations from a friendly stranger.	hit:8031_conv:16062_4_286
My little brother failed his French class and had to spend three weeks in summer school.	hit:8036_conv:16072_1_580
Oh no, that's not good! He's not the only one that's not great at French. Most of my family spoke French as a second language when I was growing up and I still never picked it up!	hit:8036_conv:16072_2_286
French is a really hard language, I have trouble too so it really hurt my heart seeing him go to school while all his friends and siblings were having fun without him.	hit:8036_conv:16072_3_580
Hopefully he'll get to enjoy his next summer.	hit:8036_conv:16072_4_286
My boyfriend's brothers got into a fist fight one night and he jumped in the middle.	hit:8044_conv:16089_1_13
That sucks. Did anyone get hurt?	hit:8044_conv:16089_2_209
Some things got broke and there were some bruises, but it was really scary to watch that.	hit:8044_conv:16089_3_13
I bet. I would've hid under the table.	hit:8044_conv:16089_4_209
i am blessed to have a great family	hit:8047_conv:16095_1_44
That's nice. Why do you say that?	hit:8047_conv:16095_2_209
they're just the best and always very helpful	hit:8047_conv:16095_3_44
That's great to hear. I wish I had a helpful family.	hit:8047_conv:16095_4_209
Whenever my sister in law plans things, she only does it around her schedule.	hit:8055_conv:16110_1_13
That's really selfish. Have you talked to her about it?	hit:8055_conv:16110_2_209
Yeah, but she says she tries her best and thinks she is doing what is best for everyone. However, we are the only ones with kids on a schedule.	hit:8055_conv:16110_3_13
Well, at least that's the case. People can only do so much.	hit:8055_conv:16110_4_209
This weekend was kind of a drag.	hit:8060_conv:16120_1_599
Oh yeah? Why is that?	hit:8060_conv:16120_2_13
I couldn't find anyone that wanted to hangout so I had to spend the whole weekend by myself.	hit:8060_conv:16120_3_599
Well sometimes that isn't a bad thing really. You didn't enjoy it at all?	hit:8060_conv:16120_4_13
I was feeling quite social, though, so it was kind of a buzzkill.	hit:8060_conv:16120_5_599
The vacations I used to take when I was younger with my family have been on mind lately.	hit:8060_conv:16121_1_13
Are the good memories at least?	hit:8060_conv:16121_2_599
Oh yeah, but it really makes me miss those times.	hit:8060_conv:16121_3_13
At least you have those memories. You should go on a vacation soon!	hit:8060_conv:16121_4_599
I'm looking forward to this new game.	hit:8069_conv:16138_1_599
Which one?	hit:8069_conv:16138_2_385
The new Spyro Remastered. It really makes feel think back to when I used to play the original with an old friend of mine. 	hit:8069_conv:16138_3_599
I've actually haven't played that series. When does it come out?	hit:8069_conv:16138_4_385
It comes out next month!	hit:8069_conv:16138_5_599
I told my sister in law that I would help her with her books. After this last one, I felt bad because I told her I couldn't anymore.	hit:8070_conv:16141_1_13
That's rough. Why can't you help her?	hit:8070_conv:16141_2_209
I just have too much going on now with two kids, and working from home.	hit:8070_conv:16141_3_13
Yeah, I am in the same boat. It's a hard knock life out there.	hit:8070_conv:16141_4_209
I saw some person eat like 30 hamburgers in Mcdonalds	hit:8074_conv:16148_1_547
How long did it take them?	hit:8074_conv:16148_2_4
I think he was making a Youtube video so he was eating very fast, so like 10 minutes	hit:8074_conv:16148_3_547
He must of been sick after.	hit:8074_conv:16148_4_4
One time I bought emergency supplies before a hurricane	hit:8080_conv:16160_1_547
That was probably a good plan to buy them ahead of time	hit:8080_conv:16160_2_301
Yup, people started charging like $5 per bottle of water	hit:8080_conv:16160_3_547
Wow, thats insane.  I feel like thats illegal	hit:8080_conv:16160_4_301
I just got some frustrating news the other day.	hit:8081_conv:16163_1_599
What was the news?	hit:8081_conv:16163_2_4
My son got caught cheating on a test. I really thought we raised him better than to do such things but here we are.	hit:8081_conv:16163_3_599
Are you going to ground him?	hit:8081_conv:16163_4_4
Definitely at least going to have a long talk about why what he did was wrong. There will be some kind of punishment that's for sure.	hit:8081_conv:16163_5_599
My sister in law and her fiance are always taking trips abroad and we hardly ever go anywhere.	hit:8082_conv:16164_1_13
Why don't you join them?	hit:8082_conv:16164_2_4
We definitely don't have money for that, plus there are four of us.	hit:8082_conv:16164_3_13
Why don't you get another job?	hit:8082_conv:16164_4_4
Ugh. I got some awful news the other day.	hit:8087_conv:16174_1_599
That's too bad. What happened? Is everyone OK?	hit:8087_conv:16174_2_217
I got news that my grandfather passed away. He was old but no one saw it coming. 	hit:8087_conv:16174_3_599
Oh I'm so sorry to hear that. I hoep your family is strong enough to support you through this.	hit:8087_conv:16174_4_217

It was! He got a lot of cool toys, and ate a bunch of ice cream.	hit:8091_conv:16183_3_305
Those are the best times when they still like to play with toy's mine lost interest years ago and I miss it	hit:8091_conv:16183_4_411
As he opened gifts, he told people thank you, and told them thanks for coming when they left.  I was pretty proud of our 4 year-old.	hit:8091_conv:16183_5_305

Last year, during the spring, extremely heavy rainfall caused our basement to become flooded.	hit:8104_conv:16208_1_340
Oh man! I have been there, I hope you didn't have anything special down there??	hit:8104_conv:16208_2_296
I lost all of my childhood photos and many of my childhood toys and things I had saved, my bible from my late grandmother being one of the items.	hit:8104_conv:16208_3_340
Oh lord, i am so sorry! I have been there, that is hard!	hit:8104_conv:16208_4_296

Aww, I'm sorry.  Is he going to be ok?	hit:8116_conv:16233_2_310
It's not looking too good. I really hope he pulls through.	hit:8116_conv:16233_3_503
I do too.  That's one of the saddest things.  I hope you'll be OK too.	hit:8116_conv:16233_4_310

I saw a deer get hit by a car yesterday.	hit:8121_conv:16243_1_475
oh that sucks.. did someone move it out of the way?	hit:8121_conv:16243_2_238
It wasn't dead, It was injured and moved to the brush on the side of the road. it was upsetting.	hit:8121_conv:16243_3_475
yea you never like to see stuff like that.	hit:8121_conv:16243_4_238
I opened up my mailbox this morning and there was a 10 dollar bill just sitting there inside!	hit:8124_conv:16248_1_503
did you try to find its owner?	hit:8124_conv:16248_2_238
I asked my neighbors about it, no one knew anything about it. I guess it was left there intentionally.	hit:8124_conv:16248_3_503
well that was nice of someone	hit:8124_conv:16248_4_238
A co-worker I've been working on a project with has been late	hit:8130_conv:16261_1_111
That's annoying, are you going to talk to them about it?	hit:8130_conv:16261_2_100
I plan on doing that, it's pretty disruptive	hit:8130_conv:16261_3_111
I hope it all works out in the end.	hit:8130_conv:16261_4_100
I just finished a major project at work for a client	hit:8132_conv:16264_1_111
Awesome! Can you say what kind of project it is?	hit:8132_conv:16264_2_296
Not at the moment, but I'm praying my supervisor and client likes it	hit:8132_conv:16264_3_111
I hope so too! Projects can be stressful!	hit:8132_conv:16264_4_296
I have an appointment for tomorrow. I'm hoping the same thing.	hit:8139_conv:16279_1_475

Let's hope not! My prayers are with her.	hit:8139_conv:16279_4_1
I know. I'm so worried.	hit:8139_conv:16279_5_475
Thank you. I hope it's something that he will get over soon.	hit:8141_conv:16283_1_475
You're welcome. It's always nerve wrecking when family is sick like that.	hit:8141_conv:16283_2_1
5	hit:8141_conv:16283_3_475
I think there might be something wrong with the platform at the moment.	hit:8141_conv:16283_4_1
My child needs to start going to bed early to prep for school. Last night, I caught her sneaking her phone and watching tv at 12am.	hit:8145_conv:16291_1_607
Oh man, sounds like most kids. She's gonna hate it at first, but getting to bed early will help with her future.	hit:8145_conv:16291_2_1
I've tried to explain that to her. It's like it goes in one ear and out the other. It bugs me.	hit:8145_conv:16291_3_607
Well yea, they're young right now and can't see the consequences yet.	hit:8145_conv:16291_4_1
A group of coworkers who play the same lottery numbers every week won $100,000 on the pick 6 last week.	hit:8153_conv:16307_1_340
that is so lucky, they must be so happy they bought that ticket	hit:8153_conv:16307_2_507
They had asked me if I wanted to go in with them, and I said no. I regret that now, I could have really used a share of that money.	hit:8153_conv:16307_3_340
i know that is such a bomber you must have been so angry hahaha	hit:8153_conv:16307_4_507
I studied really had so I am sure I will pass my test!	hit:8154_conv:16309_1_147
What kind of test is it	hit:8154_conv:16309_2_126
It was my science final for college. 	hit:8154_conv:16309_3_147
Oh I hope you do well then	hit:8154_conv:16309_4_126
My friend went on a 14 day cruise to Europe. I wish that could have been me! 	hit:8156_conv:16312_1_347
wow i didnt even know they had cruises that go on for that long	hit:8156_conv:16312_2_238
Right? Talk about ultimate relaxation!	hit:8156_conv:16312_3_347
yea i wonder how much something like that costs .. i guess if you have to ask you cant afford it as they say	hit:8156_conv:16312_4_238
My son is supposed to be sending me some money...	hit:8159_conv:16318_1_503
that is really nice of him, how much time will you have to wait?	hit:8159_conv:16318_2_507
Hopefully not too much longer. I've been waiting for a few days now.	hit:8159_conv:16318_3_503
well i hope everything goes well at the bank and with the transaction	hit:8159_conv:16318_4_507
I am scared of another hurricane coming through Florida. I had a bad experience last year.	hit:8165_conv:16330_1_347
that is horrible, natural disaster are the worst because you cant do anything against them	hit:8165_conv:16330_2_507
No, all you can do is try to prepare. Do you live anywhere where there is threat of natural disasters? 	hit:8165_conv:16330_3_347
not really, the worst thing that can happen where i live is a thunderstorm	hit:8165_conv:16330_4_507
When my son was born it felt like I had everything I needed in life.	hit:8169_conv:16338_1_340
I bet that was a wonderful day	hit:8169_conv:16338_2_126
It really was, my life finally felt complete.	hit:8169_conv:16338_3_340
I am very happy for you	hit:8169_conv:16338_4_126
I got passed over for a promotion at work last week, even thought I had more experience than the other applicants.	hit:8189_conv:16378_1_340
that is not good, have you expressed your feelings to your boss?	hit:8189_conv:16378_2_507
I did, and it looks like I may be looking for a new job soon as they want to take the company in a new direction.	hit:8189_conv:16378_3_340
well i hope everything goes well for you, you will sure find something fitting for you dont worry	hit:8189_conv:16378_4_507
I remember when I started my first office job out of college. I was nervous because I didn't know what to expect.	hit:8199_conv:16399_1_573
It's a whole new world when that happens, I can totally understand. How'd you cope with it?	hit:8199_conv:16399_2_302
I just tried to keep an open mind and go with the flow. It was hard to get used to sitting at a desk for 8 hours a day, but I soon got used to it.	hit:8199_conv:16399_3_573
It's always best to just open your mind to anything that could happen. It's the best way to learn.	hit:8199_conv:16399_4_302
I agree. And if it doesn't work out, you can always move on to something different.	hit:8199_conv:16399_5_573
I found some mold growing out in the garage	hit:8206_conv:16413_1_111
Oh no, that's bad.   Have you had someone come out and check the hose?	hit:8206_conv:16413_2_244
I ended up cleaning it myself, I think I got most of it out	hit:8206_conv:16413_3_111
May be worth letting your insruance comapny know. Usually they have clauses that you have to tell them as soon as you see it otherwise they won't cover any of it.	hit:8206_conv:16413_4_244
I was thinking about when we finally got to go pick up Rodimus after all that waiting!  I've never been so excited in my life.  	hit:8214_conv:16429_1_97
what is that?	hit:8214_conv:16429_2_238
It's our Rotty pup! Sorry haha	hit:8214_conv:16429_3_97
oh that explains it!	hit:8214_conv:16429_4_238
Yes!  We had been waiting forever to find just the right breeder and then we found him oh my gosh.  That felt like the longest week of my life!	hit:8214_conv:16429_5_97
I saw a child ask for a candy bar that the grocery store yesterday. The mother spanked the child in front over every one in the line!	hit:8217_conv:16434_1_607
Wow when the child just asked?!	hit:8217_conv:16434_2_1
Yes! It was awful! Luckily the man behind her spoke up. I could tell she was embarrassed but I was furious at her!	hit:8217_conv:16434_3_607
I'm only afraid that the mom is going to let out that embarassment on her child once they get home.	hit:8217_conv:16434_4_1
I agree. I hate seeing kids having to live in that type of situation. some people shouldn't be parents	hit:8217_conv:16434_5_607
One time I saw someone's dog pooping in my lawn and they didn't pick it up!	hit:8219_conv:16438_1_547
OMG that's so gross! 	hit:8219_conv:16438_2_624
Yes, I wanted to throw it back at them!	hit:8219_conv:16438_3_547
That would be a memorable lesson to learn. The best lessons are learned that hard way, after all. 	hit:8219_conv:16438_4_624
I used the bathroom at Walmart the other day. I walked around the store for about 30 minutes before I realized I had toilet paper stuck to my shoe!!!	hit:8223_conv:16447_1_607
Oh god. That's kinda gross.	hit:8223_conv:16447_2_1
I felt gross hahaha I kicked it off of my shoe and stuffed it under a rack. I hope know one saw.	hit:8223_conv:16447_3_607
Rest in peace whoever touches that rack.	hit:8223_conv:16447_4_1
hahaha hope they wear gloves!	hit:8223_conv:16447_5_607
My son just started a new school.  The communication with them has been terrible!	hit:8224_conv:16449_1_26
Oh dear. How do they let the parents know what's going on?	hit:8224_conv:16449_2_624
I sometimes find out but it seems so disorganized!	hit:8224_conv:16449_3_26
That sounds really frustrating. I'm sorry that's happening!	hit:8224_conv:16449_4_624
We went to the lagoon a few weeks ago. My friends dared me to jump off of the highest cliff into the water.	hit:8226_conv:16453_1_607
Oh wow.  Terrifying.  All I think of is Johnny Erricson Tada, who broke her neck in that situation. Did you do it?	hit:8226_conv:16453_2_438
That was what I was worried about! I ended up not jumping off of the highest one. I was too scared. I did jump off of the smallest one. That was really fun!	hit:8226_conv:16453_3_607
You did the right thing!  Oh fun!  I'm glad you were safe and had a blast! 	hit:8226_conv:16453_4_438
I have a test coming up in one of my classes this week.	hit:8229_conv:16458_1_503
Do you feel ready for it?	hit:8229_conv:16458_2_35
Oh yeah, I'm definitely ready. I know I'm going to pass.	hit:8229_conv:16458_3_503
Awesome, hope it goes as planned!	hit:8229_conv:16458_4_35
I had about 6 or 7 hummingbirds in my yard the other day feeding.	hit:8235_conv:16471_1_475
Oh how exciting! Did you take any pictures?	hit:8235_conv:16471_2_288
No. my camera isn't good enough to get good pictures, they are so small.	hit:8235_conv:16471_3_475
Awww...that's a bit disappointing, but really cool that you got to see them!	hit:8235_conv:16471_4_288
I was trying to buy a piece of property that came up on the market, but someone put in a bid before I got a chance and it has already sold.	hit:8237_conv:16475_1_340
The market can be competitive if the price is right. They'll sell immediatley.	hit:8237_conv:16475_2_244
It is a piece of property that my grandfather owned and I pretty much grew up on, I would have really liked to have owned it.	hit:8237_conv:16475_3_340
That would have been awesome if you got it.	hit:8237_conv:16475_4_244
I worked for weeks on a presentation for work. I practiced over and over. I felt relaxed the morning of.	hit:8240_conv:16480_1_607
That's good! That probably means you worked on it until it became something you're proud of.	hit:8240_conv:16480_2_545
You are right! I was really proud of it! I'm glad I worked so hard on it. It lessened the anxiety that I usually have!	hit:8240_conv:16480_3_607
Maybe I could learn from that. I get really nervous when I have to do any public speaking, so maybe if I just prepared for it better it would help.	hit:8240_conv:16480_4_545
I was under the impression that my friends would pay me back.	hit:8243_conv:16486_1_588
What did they do to you?	hit:8243_conv:16486_2_43
They owed me money but never paid me back. I suppose it's not a huge deal though.	hit:8243_conv:16486_3_588
It happens sometimes. you may ask them directly to pay back.	hit:8243_conv:16486_4_43
I worked with daughter for months with learning her multiplication tables. We've practiced and practiced and she still doesn't know them all!	hit:8244_conv:16489_1_607
I totally get that.  I'm in the same place with my daughter.  I home school and she's learning them too. Give it time and she'll get it soon.  Its so much to memorize at once! 	hit:8244_conv:16489_2_438
We homeschool too! I hope she can get them soon! It will make this year's math so much easier!	hit:8244_conv:16489_3_607
That's awesome!  She will!  The best thing about homeschooling is that they can learn more at their own pace.  I'm not looking forward to division! ha ha	hit:8244_conv:16489_4_438
I'm going on a hiking trip soon	hit:8245_conv:16491_1_111
Do you hike very often?	hit:8245_conv:16491_2_545
Here and there when I have time	hit:8245_conv:16491_3_111
I've never been hiking, really! I'd like to go some day.	hit:8245_conv:16491_4_545
I scrapbook pictures of my son and I am a few years behind!	hit:8249_conv:16499_1_26
Oh, such fun!  Do you have all the Stamp It Up scrapbooking things I hear so much about? I bet it can be hard to keep it updated! They grow so fast!	hit:8249_conv:16499_2_438
My son just started school all day, so I plan to start scrapbooking.  I don't use Stamp It Up though.	hit:8249_conv:16499_3_26
Perfect!  Now you'll be caught up in no time.  I know you'll be so gratified to finish and be able to look at all of them when he's much older.	hit:8249_conv:16499_4_438
This past weekend, my cat Sam passed away, he was 17 years old.	hit:8250_conv:16501_1_340
So sorry to hear of Sam's passing.	hit:8250_conv:16501_2_43
Yeah,it's been really strange the past few days without him asleep on my feet while I work.	hit:8250_conv:16501_3_340
May your many memories of Sam help you to sustain at this difficult time.	hit:8250_conv:16501_4_43
I have nothing to complain about. Life is good.	hit:8254_conv:16508_1_588
That is awesome.  I'm with you on that.  Tough times might pop up now and then but life really is great.  I don't like to take it for granted.	hit:8254_conv:16508_2_438
No point in being a pessimist.	hit:8254_conv:16508_3_588
Exactly! You'll go far with that attitude!  	hit:8254_conv:16508_4_438
I baked a cake for my boyfriend's birthday and it turned out to be so delicious! He was so excited. 	hit:8256_conv:16512_1_347
Mmm, now you're making me hungry for cake. What kind of cake was it?	hit:8256_conv:16512_2_286
Black forest cake! It happens to be both our favorite kind of cake. I made it from scratch. What's your favorite cake? 	hit:8256_conv:16512_3_347
Personally I'm a huge fan of red velvet, but black forest is amazing too!	hit:8256_conv:16512_4_286
I felt so bad when I had to board my dog while I was on vacation. It made me feel like a bad dog mom! 	hit:8261_conv:16522_1_347
Aww, I know that can be hard, but you can't be too hard on yourself.  Sometimes you don't have a choice.	hit:8261_conv:16522_2_294
I know. She was so excited when we came home though which made us feel a bit better. 	hit:8261_conv:16522_3_347
Absence makes the heart grow fonder.	hit:8261_conv:16522_4_294
I'm happy with the person that I grew up to be.	hit:8262_conv:16524_1_588
What are some of your best traits?	hit:8262_conv:16524_2_375
I'm healthy!	hit:8262_conv:16524_3_588
Do you exercise often?	hit:8262_conv:16524_4_375
So we finally found the perfect Rotty breeder and we got to pick up our puppy this week!	hit:8264_conv:16529_1_97
Oh boy that is great news! I hope you didn't drop a pretty penny on it! Haha, and even if you did, dogs are worth it.	hit:8264_conv:16529_2_302
No he was the runt so we got him on the cheap side!  He is sooooo sweet!  I am so happy	hit:8264_conv:16529_3_97
Hey runts are the best! They need love too. Either way, I'm glad you were paired up with the perfect companion.	hit:8264_conv:16529_4_302
Thank you!  We are so excited!	hit:8264_conv:16529_5_97
I love going to Disney World. It makes me remember all the wonderful memories I made there as a child.	hit:8267_conv:16534_1_347
I've never been, but it looks like so much fun.	hit:8267_conv:16534_2_231
It is a great place for both kids and adults! I don't have any kids yet, but can't wait to bring mine when I have them someday. 	hit:8267_conv:16534_3_347
It would be so much fun to go there as a family.	hit:8267_conv:16534_4_231
Sometimes when I am out in public, my son throws a tantrum.	hit:8270_conv:16540_1_26
Oh yeah I am right there with you, I just don't even go out anymore if I can help it! How old is yours? Mines 2 1/2	hit:8270_conv:16540_2_227
Mine is 5.  Every now and then, he says a curse word, uses it properly too!	hit:8270_conv:16540_3_26
They are too smart for their own good	hit:8270_conv:16540_4_227
I was just about to make a sandwich to eat, when I discovered something really gross.	hit:8279_conv:16558_1_503
what did you see? please don't tell me there was a bug in your bread	hit:8279_conv:16558_2_50
No, there weren't any bugs. But there was mold.	hit:8279_conv:16558_3_503
ewwww, so nasty! i almost ate a molded avocado today. good thing i noticed before scooping it	hit:8279_conv:16558_4_50
The head of marketing at my job recently dumped a bunch of new tasks on me and my coworker. I feel like she's just lazy and making us do her job.	hit:8289_conv:16579_1_473
or maybe she just knows you're a great worker and very responsible? I hope you will get a raise after completing those tasks	hit:8289_conv:16579_2_52
Ha, that's a really nice way of looking at it but nah I'm pretty sure it's mostly laziness.	hit:8289_conv:16579_3_473
did you try talking to her about it? Just be straight forward and tell you how you feel	hit:8289_conv:16579_4_52
I thought about it but no, it's not worth rocking the boat. If she tries to pull that again and dump even more on us, then I'll probably say something.	hit:8289_conv:16579_5_473
I can't believe this!  Some kid at the gas station nearly hit me and then had the nerve to call me awful names!	hit:8292_conv:16584_1_97
Did you call the police?	hit:8292_conv:16584_2_126
No!  I got so flustered and kind of paniked.  	hit:8292_conv:16584_3_97
Its horrible to have to got through things like thaty	hit:8292_conv:16584_4_126
Guess what!  I nailed my review for this year and got a raise!	hit:8293_conv:16586_1_97
That's great! I'm so happy for you!	hit:8293_conv:16586_2_247
Thank you! I worked so hard and I am so freaking excited!  I am also up for a promotion if we keep growing!	hit:8293_conv:16586_3_97
Ooh, will you be managing anyone?	hit:8293_conv:16586_4_247
I freaking dropped my coffee on the ground this morning	hit:8296_conv:16593_1_97
I hear you! I drop things all the time. Was it one you just bought?	hit:8296_conv:16593_2_296
Yes.  And to make it even worse I soaked myself!	hit:8296_conv:16593_3_97
Ugh! Were you away from home?	hit:8296_conv:16593_4_296
Right outside the office and with no spare clothes!	hit:8296_conv:16593_5_97
My stepdaughter graduated from college in May and got a job in San Francisco making 3 times more than I have ever made.	hit:8297_conv:16594_1_573
Oh wow, she's doing great. I know it probably feels a bit bad that she's making so much more than you, but hopefully you can find  away to be proud of her.	hit:8297_conv:16594_2_286
I'm definitely proud! It doesn't feel bad at all. I'm so happy about how much drive she has to succeed.	hit:8297_conv:16594_3_573
Oh well that's great! Some people would get a little jealous. I'm glad you're proud of her, I'm sure she worked very hard for her success!	hit:8297_conv:16594_4_286
I'm maybe a little jealous, but I know how hard she works and how smart she has been with her decisions.	hit:8297_conv:16594_5_573
Whew. I finally got all of my work done for the day.	hit:8298_conv:16597_1_503
That is a good feeling!	hit:8298_conv:16597_2_296
It really is! Now I can go home and just relax for the rest of the evening.	hit:8298_conv:16597_3_503
Nice! No kids at home?	hit:8298_conv:16597_4_296
Nope, just me. So it's nice and quiet.	hit:8298_conv:16597_5_503
I am so nervous.  I have to go to the dentist tomorrow to get a filling replaced. 	hit:8300_conv:16600_1_97
Are you afraid of the dentist?	hit:8300_conv:16600_2_473
I am!  I had a bad experience with one when I was younger.	hit:8300_conv:16600_3_97
I'm sorry to hear that, I'm pretty terrified of the dentist myself. Ask for gas! Good luck, I'm sure everything will be just fine.	hit:8300_conv:16600_4_473
I spoke at a conference recently. I was a little scared going into it but felt great as I knew I knew my speech.	hit:8300_conv:16601_1_473
Oh nice! That's super brave of you.	hit:8300_conv:16601_2_97
I'm actually one of those fortunate people who doesn't have a fear of public speaking. 	hit:8300_conv:16601_3_473
That's a great skill to have!	hit:8300_conv:16601_4_97
I was cleaning out my attic and found a box full of old photo albums. I spent the next few hours looking at old photos and having a great time.	hit:8301_conv:16603_1_340
That must have been a nice feeling. 	hit:8301_conv:16603_2_297
It really was. I miss a lot of the people in the photos, made me really smile to see their faces again.	hit:8301_conv:16603_3_340
I love that nostalgic feeling. 	hit:8301_conv:16603_4_297
I am so irritated.  My dog keeps trying to eat up my shoes no matter where I put them!	hit:8303_conv:16606_1_97
Haha, sounds like my pupper, is she still young?	hit:8303_conv:16606_2_448
Yeah she's only about six months.  Despite all her chew toys its still my shoes she craves...	hit:8303_conv:16606_3_97
Right!? It's weird, you buy them all the toys in the world, but they still go after your stuff.	hit:8303_conv:16606_4_448
My husband works late at night and sometimes I'm stuck by myself.	hit:8304_conv:16608_1_607
Why he is working late?	hit:8304_conv:16608_2_7
He owns his own business working on cars. If something goes wrong, he is forced to stay to fix the issue.	hit:8304_conv:16608_3_607
I understand. Could you plan to do something when he is late (going out with friends)?	hit:8304_conv:16608_4_7
That's a good idea! Maybe I can have a boardgame night or something!	hit:8304_conv:16608_5_607
My aunt just signed for my cousin to get an FJ Cruiser! That is my dream car! He doesn't even have a job.	hit:8305_conv:16610_1_607
Aww man that sucks for you 	hit:8305_conv:16610_2_627
It does! Maybe he will at least let me drive it!	hit:8305_conv:16610_3_607
Hopefully! It is your dream car after all	hit:8305_conv:16610_4_627
I'm looking forward to visiting a friend over the weekend	hit:8310_conv:16621_1_111
That should be fun. Any big planes?	hit:8310_conv:16621_2_297
Nothing too big, probably just wander around town	hit:8310_conv:16621_3_111
That will be nice to catch up.	hit:8310_conv:16621_4_297
I'm so irritated at my neighbor. She moved out recently and left ALL her garbage and old furniture in our parking lot by the garbage.	hit:8313_conv:16626_1_473
That's not very considerate of her. Was she a bad neighbor while she lived there too? Some people!	hit:8313_conv:16626_2_286
Not at all, that's what is so weird! She was really polite, quiet, and neat.	hit:8313_conv:16626_3_473
I wonder what could have changed? Either way, I'd be pretty pissed off.	hit:8313_conv:16626_4_286
I am! But whatever, nothing we can do but have the city come pick it up I guess.	hit:8313_conv:16626_5_473
Last week the plant I work at was hit with massive layoffs. 	hit:8315_conv:16631_1_340
Oh no! That is terrible!	hit:8315_conv:16631_2_296
I was fortunate enough to be one of the very few who got to keep their job, I am happy but very sad for the others.	hit:8315_conv:16631_3_340
I understand. Layoffs are hard. My brother in law has been through a lot of those at factories!	hit:8315_conv:16631_4_296
Two years ago my wife and I got divorced. It has been very odd in this big house all by myself.	hit:8316_conv:16632_1_340
How do you feel these days?	hit:8316_conv:16632_2_375
It has gotten a little better with time, but still a pretty sore spot for me.	hit:8316_conv:16632_3_340
It must be difficult, do you think she will come back ever?	hit:8316_conv:16632_4_375
I lost my job earlier this year. I was really worried about how to pay my bills and finding a new job.	hit:8317_conv:16634_1_473
Ouch! That's rather painful. What are you doing now?	hit:8317_conv:16634_2_385
Well that's the cool thing... the week my unemployment ran out I got a job offer. At my former company, no less. So everything worked out!	hit:8317_conv:16634_3_473
Wow! That's like a paid vacation!	hit:8317_conv:16634_4_385
Haha that's an awesome way to think about it!	hit:8317_conv:16634_5_473
Last week a friend of mine won $2000 on a scratch off ticket. I buy those things all the time and never win squat.	hit:8321_conv:16643_1_340
Wow, that's incredible. What's their secret? 	hit:8321_conv:16643_2_392
Right place, right time I guess. Some people are just lucky.	hit:8321_conv:16643_3_340
Congrats to your friend. I hope they share!	hit:8321_conv:16643_4_392
My niece got sent home from school yesterday with that stomach bug that's going around	hit:8323_conv:16647_1_97
That's unfortunate, hope you don't get it as well!	hit:8323_conv:16647_2_290
I know!  I've been pretty worried about her.  She's such a tiny thing.	hit:8323_conv:16647_3_97
I'm sure she will be fine with some rest and a little bit of time. 	hit:8323_conv:16647_4_290
"My phone went missing. Imagine my surprise when I got a Facebook message ""from myself,"" it was the person who found it saying ""I have your phone."""	hit:8331_conv:16663_1_473
Wow... that's kind of creepy actually. Were you able to get it back?	hit:8331_conv:16663_2_392
I was! The guy was really nice and refused the cash I tried to give him as a reward.	hit:8331_conv:16663_3_473
You're very lucky he was nice and didn't steal any of your data.	hit:8331_conv:16663_4_392
Very! Lucky for me it was a cheap phone, I think if I had the newest iPhone or something I would have never seen it again.	hit:8331_conv:16663_5_473
I just got some new neighbors. I'm kinda nosy so I asked if I could take a look at how they decorated, just out of curiosity.	hit:8342_conv:16685_1_473
Did you bring them a pan of ludefisk first? What did they say?	hit:8342_conv:16685_2_392
Nah, although I did consider brownies. They were happy to meet me so it was all good. But man I couldn't believe how nice their place looked compared to mine! I am a little jealous of their interior decorating skills.	hit:8342_conv:16685_3_473
Next time they let you in, just steal all your favorite pieces of decor and replace them with brownies.	hit:8342_conv:16685_4_392
My kid was signing The Spice Girls a few years ago. She thought she had discovered a new band! She asked if I had ever heard of them before.	hit:8352_conv:16705_1_607
Yeah, they are cute like that. How old is she ?	hit:8352_conv:16705_2_225
She almost 11 now. She loves to listen to all of the bands from when I was younger. It's really cute.	hit:8352_conv:16705_3_607
I have a 10 year old like that.	hit:8352_conv:16705_4_225
My daughter practiced her gymnastics every day all summer. We just found out that she made the team!	hit:8359_conv:16719_1_607
that's amazing. watching your children succeed is so rewarding	hit:8359_conv:16719_2_463
It is! I cannot wait to see what's in store for her future! Maybe a scholarship!	hit:8359_conv:16719_3_607
that is awesome. i hope she has very much success in her gymnastic endevours.	hit:8359_conv:16719_4_463
thank you!	hit:8359_conv:16719_5_607
you are very welcome. good luck!	hit:8359_conv:16719_6_463
My grandma threw away my high school yearbooks.	hit:8361_conv:16723_1_473
That's awful! I hope that she didn't mean too!	hit:8361_conv:16723_2_478
I don't think she realized what they were. I was pretty irritated as they can't be replaced but what can you do?	hit:8361_conv:16723_3_473
Yeah, It really sounds like she didn't mean to. Sometimes you can find copies online if you look. 	hit:8361_conv:16723_4_478
Good suggestion! Really I wanted to keep all the signatures and notes from my friends but oh well. I will see them next month for our reunion anyway!	hit:8361_conv:16723_5_473
We've had our dog for over 8 years. He past away this spring.	hit:8368_conv:16737_1_607
I'm so so sorry!  We lost our chihuahua in February, so I completely understand that feeling.  Was he sick prior to passing away or was it sudden?	hit:8368_conv:16737_2_56
It was sudden. He was completely fine when we went to bed. No issues at all. Its been hard for our daughter	hit:8368_conv:16737_3_607
I think it might actually be harder to watch our kids go through that kind of loss than to actually go through it ourselves.  Our pup was our daughter's dog and she was sick prior to passing, so we knew it was coming.  Still doesn't really help though.  We ended up adopting a pup from the shelter that had lost her human mom - it was meant to me - my daughter lost her pup and this pup had lost her mom.  It's helped, something to think about at least.	hit:8368_conv:16737_4_56
I completely agree. I broke down just watching her cry at the spot where we buried him. I'm not sure if I want to get another dog yet. We have chickens so she's began to show them more attention now.	hit:8368_conv:16737_5_607
I bought my daughter her first cell phone. It's a lot of responsibility for her. I hope she is ready for it.	hit:8377_conv:16754_1_607
I am sure she will be smart with it	hit:8377_conv:16754_2_126
I hope so. She has done well with tablets so I'm hoping she'll do the same with a phone	hit:8377_conv:16754_3_607
You can always show her the ways	hit:8377_conv:16754_4_126
This is true! I also put an app on her phone to block things she's not old enough to use	hit:8377_conv:16754_5_607
I accidentally knocked over a little kid coming out of the store the other day.	hit:8381_conv:16763_1_473
Were they okay?	hit:8381_conv:16763_2_27
Yeah thankfully he was totally fine. But I felt so bad.	hit:8381_conv:16763_3_473
At least you're not getting sued	hit:8381_conv:16763_4_27
Oh man, that would be terrible. Way to look on the bright side!	hit:8381_conv:16763_5_473
Im good at that lol	hit:8381_conv:16763_6_27
I'm going skydiving this weekend. My stomach all ready hurts with fear.	hit:8382_conv:16764_1_60
Don't worry you'll be fine.  It's safe.	hit:8382_conv:16764_2_244
This is my 3rd time and I'm still scared	hit:8382_conv:16764_3_60
I'm surprised you haven't started to relax a little yet.	hit:8382_conv:16764_4_244
Have you ever went. When you looking down from 15,000 feet you get scared.	hit:8382_conv:16764_5_60
We moved into a 200 year old house. There are creeks and cracks that creep me out!	hit:8385_conv:16770_1_607
I can only imagine. At least its nice in the day time though?	hit:8385_conv:16770_2_126
Sometimes. I try to avoid that attic during any time of the day! There's also a weird door about knee-height. When you open it up, it's just big enough to fit a storage tub.	hit:8385_conv:16770_3_607
I am not sure I would do well in that house	hit:8385_conv:16770_4_126
It is really creepy! 	hit:8385_conv:16770_5_607
After my mom passed away I found all our old cassette tapes in her storage, listening to those was pretty cool.	hit:8390_conv:16780_1_473
Bet that brought back good memories.	hit:8390_conv:16780_2_375
Definitely, brought me right back to the road trips we took when I was younger.	hit:8390_conv:16780_3_473
Where did you guys usually go?	hit:8390_conv:16780_4_375
Everywhere! Sometimes we just hopped in the car and went like two or three hours from home just to do something for the day.	hit:8390_conv:16780_5_473
I've spent all day getting my kit ready for the next competition this weekend. I'm exhausted.	hit:8392_conv:16785_1_60
whats the competition on ?	hit:8392_conv:16785_2_321
Highland games. I throw the caber and heavy hammer.	hit:8392_conv:16785_3_60
Nice hope you win , ill be looking into this further 	hit:8392_conv:16785_4_321
I'm so angry at my self. I was in my performance review today and I passed wind in front of my boss. OMG 	hit:8396_conv:16793_1_60
I wonder how that was noted on your report.	hit:8396_conv:16793_2_225
I got a raise so not that bad but it was still off putting. I've heard her rip one in the past so I guess no judgement. 	hit:8396_conv:16793_3_60
Sounds like a wacky place to work.	hit:8396_conv:16793_4_225
I got a raise today. I've pushed my self hard this last year and I deserve it.	hit:8400_conv:16801_1_60
That is awesome. Congratulations. Im sure you earned every penny.	hit:8400_conv:16801_2_297
Thanks it's been a rough year. My hours were cut but I was expected to keep up the same work load. Thanks again!	hit:8400_conv:16801_3_60
Good things happen to people who put in the effort. It sounds well deserved.	hit:8400_conv:16801_4_297
For the last few nights I've heard weird sounds outside my bedroom window.	hit:8408_conv:16816_1_473
Oh no! Do you think it's a wild animal?	hit:8408_conv:16816_2_530
I don't think so, it doesn't sound like any animal I recognize. It's really creepy.	hit:8408_conv:16816_3_473
I hope it's not a crazy person or worse, an alien waiting to abduct you!	hit:8408_conv:16816_4_530
I told my daughter she wasn't allowed to watch Youtube because it's hard to monitor. I caught her sneaking and watching videos last night!	hit:8411_conv:16822_1_607
Its so hard to monitor that stuff now	hit:8411_conv:16822_2_126
It is! There's also a ton of weird stuff on there that's labeled for kids.	hit:8411_conv:16822_3_607
Yeah, that is a scary thing to think about too	hit:8411_conv:16822_4_126
I walk my dog for 30 minutes at a time but no matter what, he always ends up using the bathroom inside! I wish he would left me know if he needs to go out.	hit:8417_conv:16834_1_607
On no!  That is no good!  Is he still a puppy?	hit:8417_conv:16834_2_277
No! He's about 2 years old now. Sometimes I think he does it out a spite when he's not getting enough attention!	hit:8417_conv:16834_3_607
Hopefully he is not doing it out of spite!  Maybe you should hire a dog trainer to see if they can correct his behavior.	hit:8417_conv:16834_4_277
That's not a bad idea!	hit:8417_conv:16834_5_607
My neighbor stole a package from me.	hit:8418_conv:16837_1_473
No way? Do you have proof? That is terrible.	hit:8418_conv:16837_2_297
So check this out, I ordered a planter for my porch. That's how I know he did it, the exact planter I ordered and never got appeared on HIS porch a few days after my package went missing!	hit:8418_conv:16837_3_473
Wow. That is horrible. I would get a camera and try to film them in the act and go to the police. I would be so angry.	hit:8418_conv:16837_4_297
Yeah, I'm pretty livid. I think I will report him to our HOA and see what they say.	hit:8418_conv:16837_5_473
I moved to northern Alaska last year and don't know anyone. 	hit:8423_conv:16847_1_60
you havent met all three people in the city yet?	hit:8423_conv:16847_2_238
haha. I live about 1 hour south of Barrow the most northern place in the USA and about 12 hours north of any actual city. 	hit:8423_conv:16847_3_60
ah well it sounds like i hit the nail on the head	hit:8423_conv:16847_4_238
It's the most beautiful place you can move just no one here. Me and the animals. 	hit:8423_conv:16847_5_60
My coworker was able to find a new job after only looking for like a week.	hit:8426_conv:16853_1_473
What kind of job was it	hit:8426_conv:16853_2_126
Sales, so I'm not really envious about that part as I'm not into sales but I was still upset that he found a job so easily and I couldn't. We both wanted out of that company so bad.	hit:8426_conv:16853_3_473
Sales do sound hard to do	hit:8426_conv:16853_4_126
My cat got sick the other day, he was really pathetic. I felt so bad for him.	hit:8430_conv:16861_1_473
Is he going to be okay	hit:8430_conv:16861_2_126
Yes, thankfully! The vet gave him some fluids and I made sure he got some food in him. He's doing much better today.	hit:8430_conv:16861_3_473
I am glad then, I hate to see pets in pain	hit:8430_conv:16861_4_126
My friend is a single mom who works full time. She just graduated college!	hit:8439_conv:16879_1_473
That is quite an accomplishment.  Someone like that is really inspiring.	hit:8439_conv:16879_2_294
Right? I'm so proud of her. Her accomplishment really made me think about just how lazy I am in my own life haha	hit:8439_conv:16879_3_473
Hahahaha, it's hard to compare yourself with that, but it really let's you know what's possible if you really want something.	hit:8439_conv:16879_4_294
I think I got my coworker in trouble.	hit:8449_conv:16898_1_473
Why? Were they not working?	hit:8449_conv:16898_2_60
He called in sick, but spent the day at the waterpark with his kids. I didn't realize he'd called in sick, I thought he was just out. So, I accidentally told my boss where he was.	hit:8449_conv:16898_3_473
He should have been honest from the start. It's on him not you.	hit:8449_conv:16898_4_60
Thanks, that's a good point. Or at least let me know he's going to lie so I can cover for him!	hit:8449_conv:16898_5_473
Do you think your boss will tell him it's you that told on him?	hit:8449_conv:16898_6_60
Saturday I'm climbing Mt. Elbert the highest Mountain in the lower 48. The nerves has started to set in.	hit:8449_conv:16899_1_60
That's so cool! Do you do a lot of climbing?	hit:8449_conv:16899_2_473
Not so much any more that I moved to the east coast. I do more surfing now but I was able to get off work so I fly into Colorado Thursday.	hit:8449_conv:16899_3_60
Wow, so a proper adventure then. Have fun and stay safe!	hit:8449_conv:16899_4_473
Drove past the area my Middle school was in today. It was gone. I hated it when I was in school but now that's it gone I'm sad	hit:8454_conv:16908_1_60
yea funny how that happens	hit:8454_conv:16908_2_238
It was not even that long ago I went to that school. It's been less then 10 years. They did not even build anything. It's a park now.	hit:8454_conv:16908_3_60
well at least its being put to good use	hit:8454_conv:16908_4_238
I'm going to job interview Thursday. I'm currently employed but I'm ready to move on.	hit:8459_conv:16918_1_60
Hey congrats!  Is it in the same field?	hit:8459_conv:16918_2_389
Yes, I'm currently in middle management this would be the next step up. I'm excited and nervous 	hit:8459_conv:16918_3_60
Heyyy! That's awesome!  I wish you luck! Will it come with a sweet raise too?	hit:8459_conv:16918_4_389
My cousin passed the CPA exam!	hit:8461_conv:16922_1_473
Congratulation. What is he planning to do next?	hit:8461_conv:16922_2_7
She's already working at a Big 4 firm so she's just going to stick with that for a few years. I'm proud of her, it wasn't easy!	hit:8461_conv:16922_3_473
Good. I hope it will help her in career growth.	hit:8461_conv:16922_4_7
I just got a new manager at work. She is really young but seems to be full of good ideals.	hit:8464_conv:16928_1_60
That's cool!  Maybe you'll get along great!	hit:8464_conv:16928_2_389
I plan to steer clear. I'm going to relocate in January so I just need to lay low. I hope she does a great job.	hit:8464_conv:16928_3_60
lol why do you have to steer clear?	hit:8464_conv:16928_4_389
I'm not looking to make a good or bad impression. I just want to do my job and go home. 	hit:8464_conv:16928_5_60
ahhh.  I got you!  Well good luck on the relocation!	hit:8464_conv:16928_6_389
The other weekend I really wanted to go out, but I realized I don't have any good friends left.	hit:8477_conv:16954_1_473
That is a bad realization to come to.  Where did they all go?	hit:8477_conv:16954_2_294
Well I used to hang out with a lot of my coworkers but I left that job. And just kind of drifted away from everyone else. I definitely need to find a new sport or something and make new friends.	hit:8477_conv:16954_3_473
Yeah, that is tough.  Once you get to a certain age you have to work pretty hard to meet people.  Maybe you could join a softball league, that's what I did.	hit:8477_conv:16954_4_294
The other day I was short on cash I needed to pay my phone bill. 	hit:8486_conv:16973_1_473
It can be hard these days, money is tight	hit:8486_conv:16973_2_126
So true. I lucked out though and found a $20 bill on the ground! I hope the person who lost it didn't need it really bad because it definitely helped me out.	hit:8486_conv:16973_3_473
I bet that was a nice surprise	hit:8486_conv:16973_4_126
I lost my credit card this weekend and then in the worst place Walmart.	hit:8487_conv:16975_1_284
Did you get it all straightened out?	hit:8487_conv:16975_2_10
Yes I was very stun someone did a good deed and turned it in with my wallet and all the money in it I was very grateful. 	hit:8487_conv:16975_3_284
Wow that is awesome, too rare in these times, count your lucky stars!	hit:8487_conv:16975_4_10
My oldest daughter started elementary school today I was so glad she had a great first day.	hit:8495_conv:16990_1_284
Oh wonderful!  I'm glad it went so well!  Did she already know some friends there or was it a new school for her?	hit:8495_conv:16990_2_438
A new school that's why I was kind of nervous and scared but she loved it.	hit:8495_conv:16990_3_284
Oh boy, I bet you were nervous.  I would've been too!  Sounds like she's got a great and fun year ahead of her!	hit:8495_conv:16990_4_438
My neighbor keeps letting her dog use the bathroom on her balcony.	hit:8499_conv:16998_1_473
That is just gross!  Have you spoken to her about it?	hit:8499_conv:16998_2_56
It's revolting. I reported her to the HOA but she keeps doing it. I'm going to say something if I catch her out there letting her dog out.	hit:8499_conv:16998_3_473
I hope the HOA does something about that - that's just disgusting!	hit:8499_conv:16998_4_56
The other day I made fish tacos and did nothing else all day but relax on the couch.	hit:8509_conv:17018_1_473
Bet that was a nice calming down.	hit:8509_conv:17018_2_375
Very. It was nice and chill and low pressure, just how I like it.	hit:8509_conv:17018_3_473
Did you get up to anything else fun?	hit:8509_conv:17018_4_375
Not doing anything WAS my idea of fun!	hit:8509_conv:17018_5_473
I did a walk a thon last week for back to school drive and needy kids it was s long walk but I finished it I felt so happy. 	hit:8514_conv:17029_1_284
That sounds awesome, i bet you feel proud! Its nice to do things for kids who are in need.	hit:8514_conv:17029_2_227
I did before the walk I was un-assured I would finish but I did so I was overly proud and it was a great cause that raised lots of money. 	hit:8514_conv:17029_3_284
Of course! Dont let fear of not finishing stop you from doing anything!	hit:8514_conv:17029_4_227
Went out to eat with my boyfriend the other day. Saw our waiter pick his nose and wipe it on his shirt.	hit:8517_conv:17035_1_473
Oh gross, I would lose my appetite	hit:8517_conv:17035_2_247
It really was gross. I was so grossed out I asked to get moved to the bar so we could get a different server.	hit:8517_conv:17035_3_473
Yeah, I would probably just leave the restaurant altogether	hit:8517_conv:17035_4_247
I am so scared of snakes there was one in my back yard a few weeks ago.	hit:8520_conv:17040_1_284
Oh my goodness, that is no fun.  Was it poisonous?	hit:8520_conv:17040_2_294
When I looked it up on line it was one of the garden snakes but I'm still frightened by them all lol even the harmless ones. 	hit:8520_conv:17040_3_284
They can still bite, so it's better safe than sorry.  My father-in-law just got bitten by a black snake recently-not poisonous-but still painful.	hit:8520_conv:17040_4_294
I will stay clear of them all not taking any chances. 	hit:8520_conv:17040_5_284
I'm a neat freak and my house has to stay clean and in place always such a pet peeve of mines. 	hit:8525_conv:17050_1_284
Do you have OCD?	hit:8525_conv:17050_2_375
Very bad and when my family has the house out of place I become so furious I just like things clean and in order.	hit:8525_conv:17050_3_284
I just love when the house is clean, makes you feel good.	hit:8525_conv:17050_4_375
Yes and so relaxed and peaceful. 	hit:8525_conv:17050_5_284
My supervisor totally stole all the credit for a client I brought in.	hit:8530_conv:17061_1_473
That's a bad supervisor. Did you call him/her out on it?	hit:8530_conv:17061_2_1
I totally did. And let the CEO know about his behavior.	hit:8530_conv:17061_3_473
I hope he got in trouble!	hit:8530_conv:17061_4_1
Unfortunately no, the CEO thinks he can do no wrong. Eventually he'll figure out what a jerk he is.	hit:8530_conv:17061_5_473
I start back college next week I can't wait to finish getting my degree for me and my family. 	hit:8533_conv:17067_1_284
Oh most are dreading going back to school. What's your major?	hit:8533_conv:17067_2_1
I'm going for nursing and I have dreaded going back for 6 years now but my support system pushed me to follow my dream I'm thankful to have them.	hit:8533_conv:17067_3_284
Nursing can be difficult, but if you have determination and a good support system, I'm sure you'll do great!	hit:8533_conv:17067_4_1
It is but I know the hard work will pay off in the end.	hit:8533_conv:17067_5_284
I recently applied for a promotion at work.	hit:8535_conv:17071_1_305
How'd it go?	hit:8535_conv:17071_2_1
I didn't get it.	hit:8535_conv:17071_3_305
I'm so sorry to hear that. I hope another opportunity comes up.	hit:8535_conv:17071_4_1
Me, too.  Then I found out someone else less qualified got it.	hit:8535_conv:17071_5_305
I'm shopping for a new bicycle! Can't wait to pick one out.	hit:8539_conv:17078_1_473
That sounds like fun!  Are you big into biking?	hit:8539_conv:17078_2_282
I have been recently, yes. I'm using an old beat up hand-me-down mountain bike so getting the right bike for me is going to be so much fun.	hit:8539_conv:17078_3_473
Mountain biking is great.  Is is really theraputic.  I hope you enjoy your new bike	hit:8539_conv:17078_4_282
The crime rate in my city is so high right now it breaks my heart and things need to change.	hit:8541_conv:17082_1_284
That's horrible. What can people do to change things?	hit:8541_conv:17082_2_247
First thing get the young crowd out the streets and take the weapons away a 7 year old passed this weekend because of this it is so heart breaking.	hit:8541_conv:17082_3_284
Yes! The weapons thing is so important. 	hit:8541_conv:17082_4_247
Found out recently that one of my best friends from back home died in an accident.	hit:8551_conv:17103_1_473
Oh my gosh! That is horrible! I am so sorry to hear that.	hit:8551_conv:17103_2_243
Thank you. I don't even have it in me to call her parents and offer my condolences yet, it's just too shocking.	hit:8551_conv:17103_3_473
I understand that. Just give it some time and call when you are ready.	hit:8551_conv:17103_4_243
I started my new job last week and already I feel part of the team. 	hit:8564_conv:17129_1_284
That's great. Getting good coworkers is so hit or miss sometimes.	hit:8564_conv:17129_2_1
It is and that's why I was nervous but the staff was so kind and open. 	hit:8564_conv:17129_3_284
That sounds like a wonderful place. I'm kinda jealous hahaha.	hit:8564_conv:17129_4_1
Lol don't be let's just hope I can still say this in 3 months. 	hit:8564_conv:17129_5_284
One time someone kicked my dog!	hit:8566_conv:17133_1_547
That's awful! What did you do?	hit:8566_conv:17133_2_1
Nothing! My dog was just walking passed him!	hit:8566_conv:17133_3_547
No. I mean did you yell at the person or anything after they did it?	hit:8566_conv:17133_4_1
I got laid off from a job that I really used to love.	hit:8594_conv:17189_1_473
Woah that's really bad!! Is it due to cost cutting? They let you off.	hit:8594_conv:17189_2_43
Sort of, the company was being run into the ground by poor management. It hurt at first but then I realized just how much I'd started to hate the work and the company.	hit:8594_conv:17189_3_473
it happens!! i hope you will find a better job with a better company!!	hit:8594_conv:17189_4_43
I can't believe I lost my phone today while running errands.	hit:8597_conv:17195_1_147
Oh no, that's the worst.	hit:8597_conv:17195_2_322
Sad part is I have no idea which store that's why I am so upset.	hit:8597_conv:17195_3_147
I hope you can get it back somehow!	hit:8597_conv:17195_4_322
"I ended up on one of those ""Top 40 under 40"" lists for people in my profession. Felt pretty good."	hit:8602_conv:17205_1_473
That is an amazing accomplishment.  What field are you in?	hit:8602_conv:17205_2_294
Finance, basically, but it was a little broader than that. I wish my mom were still around, she would have been so happy.	hit:8602_conv:17205_3_473
I'm sure you know that she is so proud of you!  That is really incredible!  Congratulations!	hit:8602_conv:17205_4_294
Thank you!	hit:8602_conv:17205_5_473
I was shocked my husband bought me flowers today out of the blue.	hit:8608_conv:17216_1_147
That is so romantic.  They weren't for any occasion?	hit:8608_conv:17216_2_294
Nope not at all, that's why I was so shocked! 	hit:8608_conv:17216_3_147
Were they your favorites?	hit:8608_conv:17216_4_294
I was so grossed out about the molded bread I bought today.	hit:8612_conv:17224_1_147
Oh yuck. Did you get a chance to return it to the store?	hit:8612_conv:17224_2_332
I tried to, but they had a no refund policy. 	hit:8612_conv:17224_3_147
That's crazy! I'd leave it on the counter at the store. Hopefully you aren't out much money.	hit:8612_conv:17224_4_332
Seeing my kids face when I finally brought a puppy home was priceless! 	hit:8613_conv:17227_1_147
Wow that must have been amazing!	hit:8613_conv:17227_2_397
It really was, and I got it on video too.	hit:8613_conv:17227_3_147
They're going to remember that forever	hit:8613_conv:17227_4_397
While my car was parked on the street in front of my house last week, someone ran into it and left a huge dent.	hit:8614_conv:17229_1_340
Dang, that sucks. Did you ever catch the culprit?	hit:8614_conv:17229_2_209
No, they didn't leave a insurance card or anything, just drove off. Some people are so worthless.	hit:8614_conv:17229_3_340
Yeah, that guy sounds like a jerk. Did your insurance cover the dent?	hit:8614_conv:17229_4_209
Last month my dog Skippy passed away. He was 18 years old.	hit:8618_conv:17236_1_340
Oh wow! My dog Jr died of old age too.	hit:8618_conv:17236_2_147
Man it's hard. He has been like my best friend since I was a teenager.	hit:8618_conv:17236_3_340
Oh, Did something happen to him?	hit:8618_conv:17236_4_147
My dog died of old age today.	hit:8618_conv:17237_1_147
I am sorry to hear that. Mine died of old age as well last month.	hit:8618_conv:17237_2_340
I am sorry that happened too. I never thought I would be this upset over a dog.	hit:8618_conv:17237_3_147
Me neither, but in the end, I really didn't think about him as a dog, he was just my buddy. I hope fond memories of him get you through this.	hit:8618_conv:17237_4_340
I waited the longest three weeks of my life to get something I ordered online.	hit:8625_conv:17251_1_473
That can be so aggravating. Did the company make it up to you for being so late?	hit:8625_conv:17251_2_548
It got worse. When it finally arrived, the box was all busted up and my item was broken. So yeah, safe to say they had a lot to make up for.	hit:8625_conv:17251_3_473
At least they made up for it. If they had not I wouldn't use them again.	hit:8625_conv:17251_4_548
My husband has been getting on my nerves worrying about his football team losing.	hit:8626_conv:17252_1_147
I know the feeling. What team is he rooting for? 	hit:8626_conv:17252_2_392
He is crazy about the Falcons.	hit:8626_conv:17252_3_147
I don't even know what team that is, haha. Football is lost on me. 	hit:8626_conv:17252_4_392
I am also sure I fixed my computer today.	hit:8628_conv:17257_1_147
Oh that's good, last time my computer broke was a day before I left the country	hit:8628_conv:17257_2_247
That would be a nightmare! All I had to do was replace the fan.	hit:8628_conv:17257_3_147
I took it to the apple store and it actually got fixed in 5 mins, just needed a hardware reset	hit:8628_conv:17257_4_247
My husband was just sent to Iraq and I already miss him so much.	hit:8632_conv:17265_1_147
Oh my goodness, is he with the armed forces?	hit:8632_conv:17265_2_56
Yes the army, he will be there for 2 years.	hit:8632_conv:17265_3_147
I cannot imagine how hard that is on the family and the soldier.  While I can't bring him home quicker, I do want to say thank you to you,  him and your family for your sacrifice.	hit:8632_conv:17265_4_56
I am in shock ever since my house caught on fire while I was at work.	hit:8635_conv:17270_1_147
That is horrible, did anyone get hurt?	hit:8635_conv:17270_2_628
No, thank goodness no one was home, but their is nothing left of our house.	hit:8635_conv:17270_3_147
Hopefully you had insurance and somewhere to stay.	hit:8635_conv:17270_4_628
One time I heard a large knock on my door while I was sleeping	hit:8694_conv:17389_1_547
That is scary.  What was it?	hit:8694_conv:17389_2_294
It was a couple of drug addicts trying to come in!	hit:8694_conv:17389_3_547
Gosh It's worse than I thought it would be.  What did you do?	hit:8694_conv:17389_4_294
i have very low mark	hit:8704_conv:17409_1_199
Sorry to hear that. What happened on the test?	hit:8704_conv:17409_2_366
exam mark is low in school	hit:8704_conv:17409_3_199
Hopefully next time you will get a better score and study more!	hit:8704_conv:17409_4_366
ok thank you	hit:8704_conv:17409_5_199
am so happy for my brother, he graduated with honors	hit:8719_conv:17439_1_178
He must be very smart	hit:8719_conv:17439_2_188
yah, he had done his best	hit:8719_conv:17439_3_178
It paid off. Wish I was smart like that	hit:8719_conv:17439_4_188
I am alone in the house my parents travelled, i feel lonely and afraid	hit:8725_conv:17450_1_178
Oh no. How old are you?	hit:8725_conv:17450_2_188
am 22 years of age	hit:8725_conv:17450_3_178
Is there anyone you could go and visit and maybe stay the night?	hit:8725_conv:17450_4_188
I feel lonely my friend did not make to join me i watching a movie	hit:8733_conv:17466_1_178
I'm sorry to hear that.	hit:8733_conv:17466_2_322
yah, i decided to sleep	hit:8733_conv:17466_3_178
I hope things are better next time.	hit:8733_conv:17466_4_322
Today is my anniversary! My husband planned an amazing day! He bought me my favorite chocolates and is taking me to a concert tonight! I had no idea about the concert!	hit:8743_conv:17487_1_607
That's great to hear that some really care and put effort in to their relationships!	hit:8743_conv:17487_2_296
He usually doesn't do this much! I guess after years of hinting, he's finally picking up on them! haha	hit:8743_conv:17487_3_607
Lol! Oh geez- so many take years to get it ugh! But at least he finally has! I hope he is very romantic too!	hit:8743_conv:17487_4_296
haha yeah it does! we've been together almost 15 years.	hit:8743_conv:17487_5_607
Congrats <3	hit:8743_conv:17487_6_296
I had my front door open and a cat (not mine) ran in my house.	hit:8744_conv:17489_1_475
Not yours? That is so weird, usually they  are on their way OUT not IN! Lol	hit:8744_conv:17489_2_227
I know! we were all surprised. My god was going nuts and my cat hid under the couch while we chased the stray around trying to get it out.	hit:8744_conv:17489_3_475
Did you eventually get it out? I would have been flipping bonkers! 	hit:8744_conv:17489_4_227
This has been the worst year ever for tornadoes in our area. This past spring we spent 5 hours in our basement due to all the tornadoes in our area.	hit:8751_conv:17503_1_340
That sounds terrifying! Im glad you have a basement though, it can be so dangerous if you have no underground place to shelter in!	hit:8751_conv:17503_2_227
Yes, a lot of people don't have basements, and that would be really bad. It's hard to explain to a three year old why you are in such a dark, scary place, especially when the power is all out.	hit:8751_conv:17503_3_340
Oh your right, I have an almost 3 year old and I wouldn't know how to explain it as well! That is so hard sometimes because you don't know what to say!	hit:8751_conv:17503_4_227
I was in the grocery store. I found what I needed on the top shelf. I climbed onto the bottom shelf but ended up knocking everything down!	hit:8752_conv:17504_1_607
Oh my goodness, are you alright? I bet you created a mess!	hit:8752_conv:17504_2_220
yeah! The only thing that was hurt was my pride! I've never tried to check out so quickly!	hit:8752_conv:17504_3_607
I hope you can laugh a little about it now!	hit:8752_conv:17504_4_220
My favorite band is doing their last tour. My husband bought me tickets to see their concert! He surprised me with them today!	hit:8757_conv:17514_1_607
That sounds like a great gift. That is going to be a great time.	hit:8757_conv:17514_2_297
It is! I'm really excited for it! It's tonight, so it was also a big surprise! 	hit:8757_conv:17514_3_607
Wow. I am sure you will remember this for a long time. You are going to have to think of a great surprise for him now.	hit:8757_conv:17514_4_297
I know! I wasn't really planning to do much this year hahaha	hit:8757_conv:17514_5_607
Last month, my dog Duke passed away. I got him when he was just a puppy 17 years ago.	hit:8765_conv:17531_1_340
I'm sorry to hear about that. It sounds like, to me, that he lived a long life with you though, and that you were able to spend a lot of time with him. I'm worried for my girlfriend and what she'll do when that happens to her and her dog	hit:8765_conv:17531_2_273
Yeah, we did everything together. I still have to stop myself from calling him when I go to bed at night. It's amazing how close we can get to our pets.	hit:8765_conv:17531_3_340
That's crazy, and a little heart-breaking too. I'm envious of the bond and routine it sounds like you guys had. I have yet to develop a bond like that with a pet. I hope I do at some point	hit:8765_conv:17531_4_273
I was driving around my old neighborhood and seen that the house I grew up in had burned down.	hit:8767_conv:17535_1_340
That's so sad...Did you have a lot of good memories in that house?	hit:8767_conv:17535_2_288
I spent birth till I was 17 living there, so literally all of my child hood memories. 	hit:8767_conv:17535_3_340
I'm so sorry :( At least you have your memories to look back on.	hit:8767_conv:17535_4_288
my wife got a flat tire on her way home from work and a man was kind enough to stop and help her change the tire.	hit:8769_conv:17539_1_475
That was really nice of him. I know that she had to be relieved.	hit:8769_conv:17539_2_548
As was I. I was about 50 miles away at the time and she was on the side of the highway.	hit:8769_conv:17539_3_475
Someone was watching over her.	hit:8769_conv:17539_4_548
Just over 2 years ago, my wife and I got divorced. It was so strange being in our big house all alone without her and the kids.	hit:8771_conv:17543_1_340
How long had you been married ?	hit:8771_conv:17543_2_225
Just short of 9 years. She met someone online in WoW of all places and just up and moved in with him.	hit:8771_conv:17543_3_340
Hmm. That's a bit of a strange story.	hit:8771_conv:17543_4_225
Back when I was in college, I crossed a street in wrong place and got a ticket.	hit:8774_conv:17548_1_326
I hate to hear that. I hate tickets. There are so many other things I would rather spend my money on.	hit:8774_conv:17548_2_340
Exactly, especially when you get one for just walking.	hit:8774_conv:17548_3_326
Yeah, that is such a silly thing to get a ticket for.	hit:8774_conv:17548_4_340
My wife and I are going to buy are very first brand new car this week.	hit:8774_conv:17549_1_340
Cool, what are you getting?	hit:8774_conv:17549_2_326
A Chevy Cruze. We have been working hard to get our credit score up to get a really good interest rate.	hit:8774_conv:17549_3_340
That's a nice car, you are going to enjoy it.	hit:8774_conv:17549_4_326
I took my three children camping recently, and we had a great time.	hit:8777_conv:17554_1_339
Neat! We took our daughter and her cousin camping about 2 weeks ago! Did ya'll build a fire?	hit:8777_conv:17554_2_607
Of course!  I have found that the key to a great camping experience is to have a checklist of what to bring, and follow it.	hit:8777_conv:17554_3_339
That's defiantly a priority! I hope you brought everything that you need. Forgetting something can be a pain	hit:8777_conv:17554_4_607
My daughter finally master the 1-6 times. We worked very hard on it this summer!	hit:8777_conv:17555_1_607
The 1-6 times as in multiplication?  Teaching children is so rewarding.	hit:8777_conv:17555_2_339
Yes in multiplication! I'm glad she's finally grasped them. Now we just need to work on 6-12 hahaha	hit:8777_conv:17555_3_607
I bet she was super excited to get it all down.	hit:8777_conv:17555_4_339
She was!	hit:8777_conv:17555_5_607
My daughter starts public school for the first time in 3 years! I think she is going to do great but she's a little bit nervous.	hit:8780_conv:17560_1_607
What grade is she in?	hit:8780_conv:17560_2_4
She is in 5th grade.	hit:8780_conv:17560_3_607
What kind of school was she at before?	hit:8780_conv:17560_4_4
We have been homeschooling. I'm having to go back to work now, so she's not too happy about it. I think she will be just fine that. She's well socialized 	hit:8780_conv:17560_5_607
Me and my family just came back from vacation we had a great time.	hit:8783_conv:17567_1_284
Where did you go ?	hit:8783_conv:17567_2_225
We went to Disney world in Orlando,Fl to see my kids have a great time made me happy can't wait for our next vacation.	hit:8783_conv:17567_3_284
We went there a few years back. Had a great time.	hit:8783_conv:17567_4_225
Well, I finally got a call back from that job I interviewed for the other day.	hit:8798_conv:17597_1_503
Awesome news!  What was the response?	hit:8798_conv:17597_2_310
Well, they decided not to hire me. This stinks.	hit:8798_conv:17597_3_503
Oh.  Not so good news then :(  I'm sorry.  I'm sure you'll find something!	hit:8798_conv:17597_4_310
My wife held a surprise birthday party for me. It was totally unexpected and I was shocked when I came home and so many people were there.	hit:8800_conv:17601_1_573
That's awesome, I bet you were overjoyed with it!	hit:8800_conv:17601_2_220
I couldn't believe that no one let the cat out of the bag. It must have been hard to plan.	hit:8800_conv:17601_3_573
You never know if someone is going to slip and spoil it for you, that's true!	hit:8800_conv:17601_4_220
Last week during the night someone came into my yard and stole my push mower.	hit:8802_conv:17604_1_340
Oh no!  Do you have any way of finding out who did it?	hit:8802_conv:17604_2_310
No, I called the police but it's almost impossible to track. I had to chained to a steel post, but they cut the chain with bolt cutters I guess. I sure hate thieves.	hit:8802_conv:17604_3_340
Yeah, thieves are terrible.  I mean, who would steal a mower?	hit:8802_conv:17604_4_310
My food had hair in it at a restaurant worst experience ever.	hit:8803_conv:17607_1_284
what did you do?	hit:8803_conv:17607_2_238
I called the manager over and they offered to redo the food and pay for it but I was so sicken and upset I said no thank you it ruined my whole appetite. 	hit:8803_conv:17607_3_284
yea i can see that, it happens but it sucks	hit:8803_conv:17607_4_238
I'm not one to like scary movies that much only with my husband since he loves them so much.	hit:8809_conv:17619_1_284
well atleast you watch them with him! i dont like them either. 	hit:8809_conv:17619_2_11
We watched the new movie IT I was a little frightened and creep out especially because I'm afraid of clowns lol.	hit:8809_conv:17619_3_284
Oh no, no thank you! lol ahhh i cant even. 	hit:8809_conv:17619_4_11
My wife is going away on a business trip soon.... she'll be gone for a couple of weeks.	hit:8815_conv:17631_1_503
That'll be tough.  Do you have anything you can do to keep busy?	hit:8815_conv:17631_2_310
Well, I might do some work on the house. But it's going to be awfully quiet around here.	hit:8815_conv:17631_3_503
I bet.  It's sometimes surprising how much your life revolves around the other person being in the house.	hit:8815_conv:17631_4_310
Ugh, my neighbor keeps playing his music really loud at night when I'm trying to sleep.	hit:8829_conv:17659_1_503
spray water over there	hit:8829_conv:17659_2_238
Ha, that's not a bad idea. I do need to have a word with him about it though at least.	hit:8829_conv:17659_3_503
thats good, you should	hit:8829_conv:17659_4_238
Someone at work keeps stealing my lunch from the fridge! So infuriating!	hit:8861_conv:17722_1_503
Could you get with your HR department to see if they can assist?	hit:8861_conv:17722_2_506
I might give that a try. But whoever did it had probably better hope that I don't find out who they are!	hit:8861_conv:17722_3_503
What would you do to them?	hit:8861_conv:17722_4_506
Well nothing too serious, but I'd definitely have a word or two with them!	hit:8861_conv:17722_5_503
I don't like the dark.	hit:8866_conv:17732_1_26
Yea, I used to hate it too.	hit:8866_conv:17732_2_128
I get so worried about something happening to me.	hit:8866_conv:17732_3_26
Like a paranormal type fear or a human with intent to harm type fear?	hit:8866_conv:17732_4_128
More of a human with intent to harm type fear.	hit:8866_conv:17732_5_26
I've been stuck for several weeks on a part in this video game I've been playing...	hit:8870_conv:17740_1_503
is it really hard? or you just have not have that much time to paly	hit:8870_conv:17740_2_507
It's pretty tough. But it doesn't matter now... I let a friend of mine have a try, and he got through it right away! It was pretty impressive to see.	hit:8870_conv:17740_3_503
yeah some people are just naturaly good at video games	hit:8870_conv:17740_4_507
So the fiance managed to rewire one of the wall outlets yesterday!	hit:8875_conv:17751_1_97
That's pretty impressive, does he have any training or just all self taught?	hit:8875_conv:17751_2_100
A little bit of both!  I didn't know he had these skills but it was really neat to watch!	hit:8875_conv:17751_3_97
Well it's certainly nice to have someone around with handy knowledge like that!	hit:8875_conv:17751_4_100
Ugh, my neighbor's dog just keeps barking all day long. It's driving me insane.	hit:8877_conv:17754_1_503
That is frustrating!  We have a couple down the street that raises hunting dogs.  So annoying all day!	hit:8877_conv:17754_2_562
It really is. And I've talked to him a few times about it, but he doesn't seem to care at all.	hit:8877_conv:17754_3_503
I am sure he thinks it's his world, the rules dont apply to him.  Sorry you have to deal with that people can be so rude	hit:8877_conv:17754_4_562
My brother is getting out of jail next week.	hit:8885_conv:17770_1_503
Well you must be happy about it.	hit:8885_conv:17770_2_203
Not really... I'm the one that turned him in. And I'm scared that he might know about that.	hit:8885_conv:17770_3_503
Oh! that is bad then.  Be careful.	hit:8885_conv:17770_4_203
I have a Dr appointment tomorrow to make sure my cancer is still in remission.	hit:8886_conv:17773_1_475
I hope you hear good news.	hit:8886_conv:17773_2_225
I think I will. It's been 7 years since my last treatment. I still get nervous when I have my checkups though.	hit:8886_conv:17773_3_475
I understand. I guess you'll always feel that way.	hit:8886_conv:17773_4_225
My brother is supposed to be paying me back for the food I bought for him last week...	hit:8887_conv:17774_1_503
It was nice of you to buy him food, but I'm thinking he didn't pay you back.	hit:8887_conv:17774_2_536
Nope, I've been waiting for a few days, and I could really use that money now.	hit:8887_conv:17774_3_503
I'm sorry. I know it sucks to need money and be counting on it, and then you don't get it. I hope he pays you back soon.	hit:8887_conv:17774_4_536
I stepped out of my front door this morning... and right into an unpleasant surprise that my neighbor's dog left for me.	hit:8891_conv:17783_1_503
Ugh! I use to have the same problem with my neighbors dog who would poop in my driveway! At least it was my tires and not my feet that got the unpleasant surprise.	hit:8891_conv:17783_2_286
Yeah.... the smell was so bad. It took forever to get that off of my shoe.	hit:8891_conv:17783_3_503
Does this happen often? I'd let my neighbor know about it.	hit:8891_conv:17783_4_286
I got a phone call from a friend that I haven't heard from in a really long time.	hit:8894_conv:17789_1_503
That's great! You must have been so surprised and pleased to hear from them.	hit:8894_conv:17789_2_343
I was! It was so great hearing from her again.	hit:8894_conv:17789_3_503
I bet you had tons of catching up to do!	hit:8894_conv:17789_4_343
I have a meeting with my boss in a few hours...	hit:8896_conv:17793_1_503
The way you wrote that makes it seem like you're anticipating something bad... Do you mind if I ask what you're expecting to happen?	hit:8896_conv:17793_2_273
See, that's the thing... I have no idea what to expect. That's why I'm so nervous about it.	hit:8896_conv:17793_3_503
Interesting... well then at least that leaves the possibility for something good instead. If you're not sure what it could be, then at least it's not some obvious mistake or negligence on your part. I hope for the best for you	hit:8896_conv:17793_4_273
My mother is getting very old. And she really isn't in great health these days...	hit:8902_conv:17805_1_503
That is unfortunate, my own mother was ill for several years, she is getting older as well. Do you get to see her often?	hit:8902_conv:17805_2_633
Yeah, I try to go see her at least twice a week. I'm not sure how much longer she'll be with us.	hit:8902_conv:17805_3_503
Just spend what time you can with her, I'd like to say something really profound but aging parents is a situation that just sucks. Sorry you are having to deal with it.	hit:8902_conv:17805_4_633
When I was out of work my car broke down and since it was my only car a friend of mine actually gave me his old car to replace it. It was such a nice gesture.	hit:8910_conv:17821_1_475
That was great of him!	hit:8910_conv:17821_2_99
It was. I insisted that I pay him after I got a job but he wouldn't take the money.	hit:8910_conv:17821_3_475
He sounds very nice!	hit:8910_conv:17821_4_99
I finished a major work assignment in a short amount of time	hit:8916_conv:17833_1_111
Oh really what was the assignment	hit:8916_conv:17833_2_435
It was a presentation that had to be quickly put together.  My supervisor seemed pleased	hit:8916_conv:17833_3_111
It's always great to get back positive feedback!	hit:8916_conv:17833_4_435
I remember when the PS4 was first launching.  It was the first game console I ever ordered onilne and I was really looking forward to having it delivered.	hit:8933_conv:17867_1_403
What was it like when it showed up on your door?	hit:8933_conv:17867_2_445
I was watching the front door like a hawk, and constantly checking for online tracking updates.  I kept worrying that someone would steal it of my porch if I didn't get it right away.	hit:8933_conv:17867_3_403
Thats hilarious, You finally got it though uhuh?	hit:8933_conv:17867_4_445
Oh yeah.  As soon as I heard the knock I flung the door open and snatched it in a hurry.	hit:8933_conv:17867_5_403
A friend was supposed to meet me for lunch, but didn't show	hit:8937_conv:17874_1_111
Im sure they had a good excuse.	hit:8937_conv:17874_2_297
He said he was busy with work, so I suppose so	hit:8937_conv:17874_3_111
Oh I see. Hopefully its just that one time where he couldnt get to his phone to let you know.	hit:8937_conv:17874_4_297
I accidentally left my phone at a restaurant	hit:8944_conv:17889_1_111
Oh crap! how long untill you realized?	hit:8944_conv:17889_2_445
A few minutes after leaving, I was able to get it back	hit:8944_conv:17889_3_111
Thats so good, man I have done that a time of two.	hit:8944_conv:17889_4_445
I'm sure I will pass my law exam.	hit:8950_conv:17901_1_259
I am sure you will as well. Confidence is great!	hit:8950_conv:17901_2_139
Thank you. I'm almost done with school!	hit:8950_conv:17901_3_259
Congratulations. You have done great!	hit:8950_conv:17901_4_139
A friend got a new car	hit:8957_conv:17914_1_111
That's really cool. What kind of car?	hit:8957_conv:17914_2_478
BMW, it was a model I had been looking to get myself 	hit:8957_conv:17914_3_111
That  sounds like a really awesome car!	hit:8957_conv:17914_4_478
I carry around the ticket stub from the first concert I attended in my wallet.  It brings back good memories I had spending time with my friends.	hit:9006_conv:18012_1_403
Aww, that's really sweet and sentimental. I like that. Can you still read the words on it?	hit:9006_conv:18012_2_644
The edges are a little frayed but I can still make out everything on it.  I keep it in a zippered compartment to preserve it.  Maybe I'll frame it someday.	hit:9006_conv:18012_3_403
I was going to say, yeah, that's the kind of thing I would love to preserve in a frame or something for my office. How cool!	hit:9006_conv:18012_4_644
Yeah, it's a nice little souvenir to remind me of good times.  It was a great concert and experience for all of us.	hit:9006_conv:18012_5_403
Who did you go see? And are you still friends with all the same people? I wonder if any of them kept their ticket stubs too.	hit:9006_conv:18012_6_644
We went to see Incubus, it was our favorite band going through high school.  I went with my best friends who I'm still best friends with, and they actually did keep theirs too. 	hit:9006_conv:18012_7_403
Hey, the other day I didn't have a pen while trying to fill out some paperwork	hit:9009_conv:18018_1_482
that stinks. what did you do?	hit:9009_conv:18018_2_463
Yeah! Well I was in a parking garage so I went walking to try and find someone to borrow a pen from	hit:9009_conv:18018_3_482
and did you find one?	hit:9009_conv:18018_4_463
I did, this really nice woman just gave me a very fancy one. She told me to keep it!	hit:9009_conv:18018_5_482
oh that is awesome. and you got a fancy pen out of it	hit:9009_conv:18018_6_463
Hi! I had ear surgery a few months ago	hit:9027_conv:18054_1_482
Did it went well?	hit:9027_conv:18054_2_7
Yeah it went really well actually, the result was better than I had hoped for in fact!	hit:9027_conv:18054_3_482
That is great. What was the issue with your ear?	hit:9027_conv:18054_4_7
Thanks! I had a bone that had fused inside my ear and made me deaf, and they replaced it with a titanium piston!	hit:9027_conv:18054_5_482

you made quick work out of that	hit:9035_conv:18070_2_238
Yeah, I was really happy that the unloading took as little time as it did.	hit:9035_conv:18070_3_318
i wish i could unload that fast	hit:9035_conv:18070_4_238

It was a brown recluse. I had no clue that I had poisonous spiders at my house.	hit:9039_conv:18078_3_259
how in the world did it get in your house? were you able to kill it?	hit:9039_conv:18078_4_463

I got a new job and it is so great and I have my old supervisor to thank she's the best.	hit:9093_conv:18186_1_284
Why you need to thank her? Is she the one that helped you to find the new job?	hit:9093_conv:18186_2_7
She was a great influence and gave me words of encouragement to branch out and go for more then our company job.	hit:9093_conv:18186_3_284
She is very nice person. That is great.	hit:9093_conv:18186_4_7

What? Do you have evidence supporting this	hit:9139_conv:18278_2_119
I sure do I have it on video and made a report with the police already.	hit:9139_conv:18278_3_147
Good hope that bitch goes to hell...sorry I love animals and my mom's dog died the same way	hit:9139_conv:18278_4_119
I am so annoyed my neighbor's trash always ends up in my yard.	hit:9144_conv:18288_1_147
That is a big deal.  What are you going to do?	hit:9144_conv:18288_2_322
I have tried everything, but they keep doing it even after paying huge fines.	hit:9144_conv:18288_3_147
I would throw trash in their yard.	hit:9144_conv:18288_4_322
My husband has been on his second tour in Iraq. Seems like I wont see him in forever. 	hit:9147_conv:18295_1_147
He sounds like a real hero though. I hope he comes home safe soon	hit:9147_conv:18295_2_126
Thank you, The kids and I miss him terribly. 	hit:9147_conv:18295_3_147
I can only imagine. At least you have each other 	hit:9147_conv:18295_4_126
I lost everything in the fire today.	hit:9149_conv:18298_1_147
Are you and your family okay?	hit:9149_conv:18298_2_126
We are thank heavens, but we lost everything. 	hit:9149_conv:18298_3_147
I am sorry, you can replace it though	hit:9149_conv:18298_4_126
I once left all cash and didn't have any to pay for a metro ride, some random girl paid for me without saying a word.	hit:9150_conv:18300_1_326
Wow!  How kind is that!  Their really are kind people left in this world.  How did you respond?	hit:9150_conv:18300_2_485
Yes, and I am thankful for those kind of people.	hit:9150_conv:18300_3_326
*There* oops.  Did you ever find out her name?  Or find out a way to thank her?	hit:9150_conv:18300_4_485
Last week on the way to work, I did not notice my wife had ran my car so low on gas and I ended up running out of gas on the freeway.	hit:9155_conv:18310_1_340
On no! Did you have to walk, or did you call for service?	hit:9155_conv:18310_2_147
A nice man stopped, help me push my car to the shoulder and even had a can of gas he let me use in his trunk. Talk about a nice guy.	hit:9155_conv:18310_3_340
Wow, you got lucky! Did you give him a tip?	hit:9155_conv:18310_4_147
I got caught cheating on my test. I feel so horrible.	hit:9155_conv:18311_1_147
Why did you feel you had to cheat? I am sure you could have passed if you had studied.	hit:9155_conv:18311_2_340
I just wanted to make sure I passed. But now I have a big 0.	hit:9155_conv:18311_3_147
Well, don't let this one situation define you. Use it as a learning experience and move on, and do you best not to repeat it.	hit:9155_conv:18311_4_340
I had an accident today and I never want to show my face again at work.	hit:9159_conv:18318_1_147
That's so sad! What on earth happened?	hit:9159_conv:18318_2_209
I accidentally peed my pants when I was laughing. 	hit:9159_conv:18318_3_147
Now that is quite embarrassing! What did your co-workers say?	hit:9159_conv:18318_4_209
They all laughed and posted it on facebook.	hit:9159_conv:18318_5_147
My daughter made straight A's all year. I am so happy.	hit:9163_conv:18327_1_147
That is wonderful!  She must be so proud of herself and I know you are proud of her.  Its great that she likes learning so much.	hit:9163_conv:18327_2_438
Yes I agree. I let her choose our vacation this summer. She cried because she was so happy.	hit:9163_conv:18327_3_147
Awww, what a great idea!  That's so cute! Where are you guys going?	hit:9163_conv:18327_4_438
I could never send my parents to a nursing home. I look after them now.	hit:9167_conv:18334_1_147
You are such a good person to do that!	hit:9167_conv:18334_2_322
Thank you! They say they feel like they are the kids and it makes them feel young again.	hit:9167_conv:18334_3_147
It's crazy how the tables turn!	hit:9167_conv:18334_4_322
I think I will never walk into the local grocery store again.	hit:9169_conv:18339_1_147
Why do you say that	hit:9169_conv:18339_2_126
It was raining today, and when I walked into the store I slipped and fell right on my face.	hit:9169_conv:18339_3_147
Oh no, were you okay	hit:9169_conv:18339_4_126
I can't show my face in the bank ever again!	hit:9176_conv:18353_1_147
Oh my goodness, what happened? Did they find out you owe money to the local crime families? Those bank employees need to mind their own business, am I right!?	hit:9176_conv:18353_2_644
How did you guess? You are exactly right. Now they are talking about alerting the police!	hit:9176_conv:18353_3_147
That is absolutely unacceptable. Snitches get stitches, that's what I say. Tell me where they're at and I'll roll up on 'em and tell 'em what for. Just say the word. I've got your back.	hit:9176_conv:18353_4_644
I need someone to stay with my elderly mother for a few hours in my home. 	hit:9180_conv:18361_1_122
have you asked your friends for family?	hit:9180_conv:18361_2_514
No one is available. She asked someone that I don't know and they are coming. I am a little uneasy.	hit:9180_conv:18361_3_122
i would def feel that way.its hard when you dont know the person or can trust them	hit:9180_conv:18361_4_514
I guess I just have to hope for the best and hope I don't get robbed or worse.	hit:9180_conv:18361_5_122
My husband just told me the best news ever!	hit:9181_conv:18363_1_147
Oh yeah? And what news might that be?	hit:9181_conv:18363_2_209
My husband just signed with the NFL. I never knew he was that good!	hit:9181_conv:18363_3_147
Nice! Did he sign up to be a waterboy?	hit:9181_conv:18363_4_209
So, I just found our my husband is cheating on me.	hit:9188_conv:18377_1_147
Oh my goodness, that's terrible!	hit:9188_conv:18377_2_322
I am soo mad. I can't believe he did this after being married for 15 years.	hit:9188_conv:18377_3_147
What do you plan on doing?	hit:9188_conv:18377_4_322
I don't think I will go outside in the dark ever again.	hit:9195_conv:18391_1_147
uh oh. did something happen?	hit:9195_conv:18391_2_1
Yes, I was robbed at gun point while walking home from work.	hit:9195_conv:18391_3_147
That must be traumatizing. Most people wouldn't want to go out alone after that. It's understandable.	hit:9195_conv:18391_4_1
I have been pacing waiting to hear back from Walmart after my interview. 	hit:9199_conv:18398_1_147
Do you think you will get the job?	hit:9199_conv:18398_2_322
Not sure, but I really need this job to support my kids.	hit:9199_conv:18398_3_147
I hope you end up getting it!	hit:9199_conv:18398_4_322
I like to watch all the music and guitar covers on YouTube.  There's a lot of talented folks out there nowadays.	hit:9207_conv:18415_1_403
Oh definitely, Youtube is a great platform for these talented people	hit:9207_conv:18415_2_247
Yeah, it never ceases to amaze me the kinds of things you can see on YouTube.  Endless content to discover.	hit:9207_conv:18415_3_403
Yeah, my favorite is watching short comedy videos of my favorite drag queens	hit:9207_conv:18415_4_247
I like to watch either acoustic guitar covers or vocal covers.  Makes me jealous I don't have the skills to do the same.	hit:9207_conv:18415_5_403
I am still waiting to hear the results from the doctor.	hit:9210_conv:18420_1_147
do you think there something wrong	hit:9210_conv:18420_2_27
They think I may have brain cancer. I can't seem to even sit still waiting for that phone call.	hit:9210_conv:18420_3_147
oh no thats terrible Im sorry to hear that	hit:9210_conv:18420_4_27
I am waiting to find out if I really won the lottery.	hit:9216_conv:18433_1_147
Me too! I bought about a thousand dollars worth of tickets last night!	hit:9216_conv:18433_2_209
Wow. I spent $500.00 myself. I hope it pays off!	hit:9216_conv:18433_3_147
You and I both! No matter who wins, let's promise to split the pot.	hit:9216_conv:18433_4_209
I will be going on a once in a life time trip tomorrow.	hit:9220_conv:18440_1_147
Oh nice, where are you going?	hit:9220_conv:18440_2_247
I will be going on my first cruise. 	hit:9220_conv:18440_3_147
Wow, I've never been on a cruise before. I think it sounds like a lot of fun	hit:9220_conv:18440_4_247
I can never thank my mom enough.	hit:9226_conv:18452_1_147
Why? What did she do?	hit:9226_conv:18452_2_322
She helped us pay off our house so it didn't go into foreclosure. 	hit:9226_conv:18452_3_147
She is a special woman.	hit:9226_conv:18452_4_322
I am not sure how to address to my husband about how I feel about him getting a phone number from another girl.	hit:9230_conv:18461_1_147
I would be downright furious. Start by smacking him across the face randomly at dinner. That should be a good segway into the conversation.	hit:9230_conv:18461_2_209
That is how I feel. I don't think he understands how it makes me feel inside. 	hit:9230_conv:18461_3_147
Oh, he certainly will when he feels the hot, guilty tears running down his face from that strong, independent, jealous filled slap!	hit:9230_conv:18461_4_209
I am still in shock at the damage yesterdays flood caused. 	hit:9234_conv:18468_1_147
Was any of your stuff damaged?	hit:9234_conv:18468_2_209
Yes, our whole house was swept out to sea.	hit:9234_conv:18468_3_147
Oh wow! I am sorry to hear that. Maybe you can go find it and sail it to go kill Moby Dick to make up for the damages.	hit:9234_conv:18468_4_209
I know I got this job, just waiting for the conformation. 	hit:9238_conv:18476_1_147
Exciting! Are you moving to a new company?	hit:9238_conv:18476_2_247
No, this is the first job I have ever had just out of high school.	hit:9238_conv:18476_3_147
Oh fun! I'm so excited for you. Try to learn as much as possible from this job and ask for career development opportunities!	hit:9238_conv:18476_4_247
I never thought I would see something this gross ever!	hit:9242_conv:18485_1_147
Oh geez! What on earth was it!	hit:9242_conv:18485_2_209
I saw a guy pick a piece of chewed gum off the sidewalk and put it in his mouth.	hit:9242_conv:18485_3_147
That is FRIGGIN revolting!!! I would have lost my lunch right then and there!	hit:9242_conv:18485_4_209
Today, was the worst day ever!	hit:9248_conv:18496_1_147
No way. What happened? If honestly, almost all my days are like this. So, worst has become normal for me	hit:9248_conv:18496_2_155
That is so sad. I was turned down for my promotion at work to someone with less experience than me. 	hit:9248_conv:18496_3_147
Don't get it personally. Good performance will always catch other's attention. Just continue doing your work	hit:9248_conv:18496_4_155
I am pretty happy with my life right now.	hit:9252_conv:18504_1_147
That's awesome! Always good to be content with life.	hit:9252_conv:18504_2_366
It took a long time. But I always tell people to plan for the future! 	hit:9252_conv:18504_3_147
It's good to be prepared for anything because you never know what could happen.	hit:9252_conv:18504_4_366
I never knew I would feel this much love having kids.	hit:9256_conv:18512_1_147
Definately! I have one daughter and twins on the way... I foresee love overload. How many do you have?	hit:9256_conv:18512_2_397
Congrats. I love every bit of motherhood. I have 3 kids. They are 7,5, and 2	hit:9256_conv:18512_3_147
Thanks, Motherhood truly is amazing	hit:9256_conv:18512_4_397
Do you felt sad or emotioned during your work	hit:9260_conv:18521_1_508
Not really, do you?	hit:9260_conv:18521_2_247
Some time I felt disgusted with my work	hit:9260_conv:18521_3_508
Oh I'm so sorry to hear that, i hope it picks up for you, maybe listen to a little music to lift your spirits	hit:9260_conv:18521_4_247
Yes I love to hear music	hit:9260_conv:18521_5_508
I didn't think I would feel this bad for stealing diapers.	hit:9261_conv:18522_1_147
Oof, sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do I guess	hit:9261_conv:18522_2_247
I felt so bad I brought them back. I am happy I wasn't arrested. But it was only half a pack I brought back.	hit:9261_conv:18522_3_147
Well you tried to make things right, you're still a good person	hit:9261_conv:18522_4_247
Do you feel that you are satisfied with your work	hit:9267_conv:18535_1_508
i can say that i am satisfied with where i am what i do and what its done for me. are you?	hit:9267_conv:18535_2_514
Great! I am very happy with work, I am loving it	hit:9267_conv:18535_3_508
im glad to hear that!	hit:9267_conv:18535_4_514
Thank you so much	hit:9267_conv:18535_5_508
I would be in bad shape if I didn't pack extra clothes.	hit:9268_conv:18536_1_147
What are you packing extra clothes for? Did you go somewhere did something happen?	hit:9268_conv:18536_2_138
We went on vacation. And we all ended up with the stomach virus so you can guess from there lol	hit:9268_conv:18536_3_147
What are you packing extra clothes for? Did you go somewhere did something happen?	hit:9268_conv:18536_4_138

Super excited to see Taylor Swift! He knew I was a fan.	hit:9274_conv:18549_3_147
OH MY GOD, I'm so jealous, she isn't coming to my city this time. You're gonna have a great time	hit:9274_conv:18549_4_247
I just found out I was having twins. I already have 3 kids.	hit:9281_conv:18563_1_147
Wow, that will be a busy house	hit:9281_conv:18563_2_247
Yes, I agree. I was super worried, but decided to think more positive and I know I will be able to handle it.	hit:9281_conv:18563_3_147
That's a great attitude, I hope you and your family stay happy and healthy	hit:9281_conv:18563_4_247
I feel so bad lying to my husband.	hit:9285_conv:18571_1_147
What did you lie about, are you going to tell him?	hit:9285_conv:18571_2_445
I might as well since I feel so bad. I pretended to be sick because I didn't want to spend 3 days at my in law's house this holiday weekend.	hit:9285_conv:18571_3_147
HAHAHA if anything that is excusable, noone like inlaws!	hit:9285_conv:18571_4_445
There have been more tornadoes in my area this year so far than any year in recent memory. We have spent a lot of time in the basement.	hit:9305_conv:18610_1_340
How scary! I'm terrified thinking a tornado could pass by here	hit:9305_conv:18610_2_397
It's so much worse when the power is out and all we have is a few candles and flashlights.	hit:9305_conv:18610_3_340
Well I hope nothing crazy happens and you guys stay safe!	hit:9305_conv:18610_4_397

Wow, that's very nice of him! Was there a lot of people there?	hit:9309_conv:18619_2_469
Yes almost my entire family! The only one that wasn't there was my son. He couldn't come because he had to work.	hit:9309_conv:18619_3_327
That's too bad. I hope you had a blast!	hit:9309_conv:18619_4_469
I did! We had pizza, cake, chips, all kinds of goodies that I love.	hit:9309_conv:18619_5_327
There is suppose to be a huge storm coming. I went to the store and got supplies so i am ready.	hit:9333_conv:18667_1_327
That's a good idea! It's always smart to be on the safe side.	hit:9333_conv:18667_2_366
We usually don't have horrible storms so i never do it, but i have heard this one is going to be a bad one.  i just want to be ready	hit:9333_conv:18667_3_327
I've done that as well where nothing ends up happening but I bought all this stuff. You never know what could happen though.	hit:9333_conv:18667_4_366
I am looking forward to going on vacation in october! i need a vacation	hit:9341_conv:18682_1_327

I can't stop thinking about it.  I keep replaying the scene in my head, it was so bad.	hit:9351_conv:18703_3_327
I am sure people forgot already.	hit:9351_conv:18703_4_4
I am suppose to start a new job tomorrow. I am not sure I am going to like it	hit:9360_conv:18720_1_327
What job is it?	hit:9360_conv:18720_2_4
i will be working at a daycare. i love kids, but i am not sure i will like working with so many at once.	hit:9360_conv:18720_3_327
Only one way to find out.	hit:9360_conv:18720_4_4
My son is getting ready to go into the military! I am so pleased with him	hit:9366_conv:18732_1_327
What branch of the military then?	hit:9366_conv:18732_2_55
The marines. He has always wanted to join.  I am glad he is finally getting to. 	hit:9366_conv:18732_3_327
The marines is by far my favorite so good for him!	hit:9366_conv:18732_4_55
My electricity is out again! I pay a lot for the service, and i can never count on it. It goes out when the wind blows!	hit:9374_conv:18749_1_327
Oh no that's horrible. Have you complained to the electric company?	hit:9374_conv:18749_2_332
Yes but i always get the same answer, we are working to improve the infrastructure.. blah blah. I am seriously considering solar.	hit:9374_conv:18749_3_327
I would too at this point. It might be more reliable.	hit:9374_conv:18749_4_332
I think I am going to have to serve on a jury and I am terrified	hit:9378_conv:18757_1_327
That will be no fun.	hit:9378_conv:18757_2_4
No.  I hope it isn't a murder trial or something heartbreaking.	hit:9378_conv:18757_3_327
Don't you have to be selected first?	hit:9378_conv:18757_4_4
I can't believe I lost at Bingo! I spent 40 dollars and didn't win a penny	hit:9382_conv:18765_1_327
That sucks! i hate losing money as well. 	hit:9382_conv:18765_2_558
Yes, I swear there were 5 people sitting all around me that won several games.  It's just not fair.	hit:9382_conv:18765_3_327
That's how I always feel at those things as well!	hit:9382_conv:18765_4_558
Have you ever been to the zoo just to realize that animals can be just as good as humans?	hit:9383_conv:18766_1_326
I do enjoy the zoo and the animals. I think they could be just as good.	hit:9383_conv:18766_2_332
Yes, I am happy somebody shares this with me.	hit:9383_conv:18766_3_326
I think it's a good outlook.	hit:9383_conv:18766_4_332
I almost adopted a child once, but now I'm glad I didn't do it, sometimes we should stay rational.	hit:9384_conv:18768_1_326
Hopefully one day you might decide to choose otherwise or have a child of your own.	hit:9384_conv:18768_2_366
I don't know if this is something I'll ever be ready for.	hit:9384_conv:18768_3_326
It's a tough choice to make, and not everyone has to raise a child.	hit:9384_conv:18768_4_366
Have you ever mistaken a situation for something it is not and was ready for anything?	hit:9385_conv:18770_1_326
i can say that i have mistaken something for what it isnt. but not sure about the ready for anything	hit:9385_conv:18770_2_514
It's just that the other day I mistaken a guard for a tour guide and almost got in a fight.	hit:9385_conv:18770_3_326
almost? so the situation resolved itself?	hit:9385_conv:18770_4_514
I have an interview with a local ad agency tomorrow. I hope I get it!	hit:9387_conv:18775_1_327

An interview for a job.	hit:9387_conv:18775_3_327
Really? That is cool	hit:9387_conv:18775_4_329
yesterday my family surprised me on my birthday	hit:9388_conv:18776_1_568
How exactly?	hit:9388_conv:18776_2_326
well i came back from work kind of sad because i thought nobody remembered my birthday and as soon as i went inside they screamed happy birthday , not gonna lie i got really happy.	hit:9388_conv:18776_3_568
I bet you needed help to take all the presents back home.	hit:9388_conv:18776_4_326
I got into a wrong part of town the other day, I was glad to get out from there.	hit:9388_conv:18777_1_326
oh my god, how did you get out of there?	hit:9388_conv:18777_2_568
I realized I could walk very fast if I want to.	hit:9388_conv:18777_3_326
that sounds great.	hit:9388_conv:18777_4_568
In the past and even today I always felt strong in unfamiliar situations.	hit:9390_conv:18780_1_326
That's a great asset to have emotionally I think.	hit:9390_conv:18780_2_332
I agree, although I don't really know if you can train yourself to be like that.	hit:9390_conv:18780_3_326
Yeah it might just be something you're born with.	hit:9390_conv:18780_4_332
I have old cassette player and music on it is much better than what I hear on a radio today. 	hit:9391_conv:18782_1_326
I agree. Music used to have soul and good lyrics back in the day.	hit:9391_conv:18782_2_366
Yes, today it's just all about money and getting physical.	hit:9391_conv:18782_3_326
Hopefully music nowadays can take a note from the good old days and change their tune.	hit:9391_conv:18782_4_366
yesterday i went to the town where i grew up 	hit:9392_conv:18784_1_568
how did that go? did it bring back a lot of memories?	hit:9392_conv:18784_2_514
it did, so much nostalgia!	hit:9392_conv:18784_3_568
im glad to hear that. sounds like a great trip	hit:9392_conv:18784_4_514
So it was supposed to rain, but when I got out it was beautifully sunny.	hit:9393_conv:18786_1_326
Almost sounds like the erratic weather that we have here in Georgia.  I don't mind the rain as long as I'm inside.  The sun is beautiful but sometimes it can be brutal when it starts to heat up.  Do you prefer sunny days?	hit:9393_conv:18786_2_593
Sun is what makes me alive, so definitely yes.	hit:9393_conv:18786_3_326
I have to be very careful in the sun.  My allergies and the sun don't mix too well.  I can tolerate the rain much better.  I love the sound of water.	hit:9393_conv:18786_4_593
When I walk past old people I feel fortunate that I'm still young.	hit:9395_conv:18790_1_326
i can agree with that. i do feel the effects of age creeping up on me though	hit:9395_conv:18790_2_514
Yes, but this part is inevitable, for now let us enjoy our young years.	hit:9395_conv:18790_3_326
def. make the best of them	hit:9395_conv:18790_4_514
When I feel an urge to get a girlfriend, I simply remember how nice it is to be independent.	hit:9396_conv:18793_1_326
It's good to explore your own interests and what makes you grow on your own.	hit:9396_conv:18793_2_366
Yes, I still think that there are good and bad sides in both of these cases.	hit:9396_conv:18793_3_326
Hopefully one day you will be willing to explore a relationship in a serious way.	hit:9396_conv:18793_4_366
I get angry when people don't use trash cans.	hit:9397_conv:18794_1_326
I once volunteered to pick up trash on the side of the road. It's amazing how much people litter	hit:9397_conv:18794_2_234
Good for you, instead of tickets this should be a punishment for everyone.	hit:9397_conv:18794_3_326
I wish. People might have more respect if they were forced to clean up other people's trash as well.	hit:9397_conv:18794_4_234
When I wake up, the first thing I do is thank life for having another day to enjoy.	hit:9400_conv:18801_1_326
Are you in a dangerous place?	hit:9400_conv:18801_2_234
No I'm not, but in away we all are in a very dangerous place, aren't we?	hit:9400_conv:18801_3_326
I suppose so. It's great that you value life so much!	hit:9400_conv:18801_4_234
i was with my friend yesterday and by accident i spilled coffee on her laptop	hit:9401_conv:18802_1_568
Oh no. Did it get ruined?	hit:9401_conv:18802_2_188
i got so embarrassed but thankfully it didn't get ruined	hit:9401_conv:18802_3_568
Close call. I once spilt tea over my laptop and the keys were all sticky for a while	hit:9401_conv:18802_4_188
my grandmother passed away last week.	hit:9403_conv:18807_1_568
Really? So sorry for the lose	hit:9403_conv:18807_2_329
i'm really sad because she used to help me with everything 	hit:9403_conv:18807_3_568
Was she sick?	hit:9403_conv:18807_4_329
yeah. heart problems	hit:9403_conv:18807_5_568
I entered a contest and I didn't win.	hit:9416_conv:18832_1_13
That's a bummer. It's never fun to not win.	hit:9416_conv:18832_2_620
No it isn't. I felt like I put a lot of effort into it too.	hit:9416_conv:18832_3_13
Hopefully you'll have better luck next time!	hit:9416_conv:18832_4_620
we changed our internet provider last week and the connection is horrible.	hit:9418_conv:18836_1_568
That's not good, we ended up lucky with who we have 	hit:9418_conv:18836_2_135
i wish we did too.. but it's okay 	hit:9418_conv:18836_3_568
Maybe you can find another one or go back to your previous company. Have you double checked with the company to make sure everything is ok? 	hit:9418_conv:18836_4_135
i haven't , i guess i'll do it later today	hit:9418_conv:18836_5_568
I was one of three finalists for a job promotion where I work. I have more than double the other candidates experience, so I feel really good about my odds.	hit:9432_conv:18865_1_340
that's wonderful! I hope you will get that promotion! What do you do?	hit:9432_conv:18865_2_52
I am a electrical engineer with more than 15 years experience. I have a really good feeling that I am going to get this job.	hit:9432_conv:18865_3_340
Good luck! Whenever you get that promotion we should go celebrate	hit:9432_conv:18865_4_52
i can't wait for summer to finish , i love winter so much	hit:9435_conv:18870_1_568
I agree, plus I love making snowmen! 	hit:9435_conv:18870_2_59
snowmen are my favourite! 	hit:9435_conv:18870_3_568
I always get sad though when they melt 	hit:9435_conv:18870_4_59
Last week I was walking and talking to one of my coworkers and I stepped into a hole I did not see on the job site. I ended up falling and spilling hot coffee all over myself in front of our client.	hit:9444_conv:18888_1_340
Ouch! Did they try to help you back up?	hit:9444_conv:18888_2_639
Yeah, my coworker did, but the damage had already been done. Pretty big shot to the ego to look like such a fool in front of your client.	hit:9444_conv:18888_3_340
Of course! Well, at least you also looked human. We all make mistakes.	hit:9444_conv:18888_4_639
We have had a record number of tornadoes in my area so far this year. My son really hates going into the basement while it is storming outside.	hit:9445_conv:18890_1_340
That sounds really scary!  Is your son afraid or is he use to it?	hit:9445_conv:18890_2_277
He is only three, so it is pretty scary for him each time. I hate to see him that way.	hit:9445_conv:18890_3_340
I would hate that as well. I hope he learns to cope with it.	hit:9445_conv:18890_4_277
I had a client meeting in Dallas, and as I was driving to the airport I heard there was going to be a lot of storms we'd be flying through. I ended up renting a car because I hate flying so much in just calm weather.	hit:9450_conv:18900_1_340
That is a lot of extra money to spen, but it is completely understandable it you are that nervous about it.  Have you ever looked into calming medications, or meditation to help your nerves?	hit:9450_conv:18900_2_294
I have, but they only cut down the anxiety instead of making it go away completely. Something about hurdling towards earth at a rapid pace in a large metal box alarms me.	hit:9450_conv:18900_3_340
I completely understand that.  My mother in law used to have really bad anxiety about flying, but she did hypnosis and it really helped. 	hit:9450_conv:18900_4_294
Last month, this area got pounded with rainfall. My entire home town was flooded and declared a disaster area.	hit:9457_conv:18915_1_340
Wow. That's intense. Did your home get any damage?	hit:9457_conv:18915_2_654
No, I move away from there some years ago, but I hate seeing the place I grew up basically destroyed now.	hit:9457_conv:18915_3_340
Yeah. I feel for you. It hurts to lose things like that.	hit:9457_conv:18915_4_654
My birthday isn't for another two weeks, but my wife gave me my gift early yesterday. She bought me a brand new laptop because mine was getting old and slow.	hit:9464_conv:18929_1_340
That is awesome.  Happy Birthday!  What kind is it?	hit:9464_conv:18929_2_294
It's a Dell with a I7 and 8 gigs of ram, even has a Nvidia graphics card. She pretty much know what I wanted.	hit:9464_conv:18929_3_340
Is that a gaming computer?	hit:9464_conv:18929_4_294
Last month our area received record amounts of rainfall. The river that is down from my house backed up so bad it flooded my entire house destroying practically everything.	hit:9469_conv:18938_1_340
Sorry to hear about that. Are the damages covered by an insurance?	hit:9469_conv:18938_2_7
Yes, we had insurance that is going to cover it, but it still sucks start from ground zero. Plus, insurance can't really replace some things.	hit:9469_conv:18938_3_340
I understand. It is always difficult to start from ground zero. Good luck.	hit:9469_conv:18938_4_7
My ex took me to six flags and wanted me to ride on a very high roller coaster.	hit:9473_conv:18946_1_13
Interesting....did you do it	hit:9473_conv:18946_2_119
Yeah, but only because he was getting mad at me. I hate heights and I was very unsure about it.	hit:9473_conv:18946_3_13
lol why would he get mad...but did you have fun in the end	hit:9473_conv:18946_4_119
My husband is so lucky I cheat on him like he did.	hit:9476_conv:18952_1_147
Why do you cheat on him?	hit:9476_conv:18952_2_506
I could have. But I didn't. He cheated on me actually.	hit:9476_conv:18952_3_147
Oh I see, why are you still with him then?	hit:9476_conv:18952_4_506
Damn, I really wanted my eBay package to arrive today, but it didn't.	hit:9478_conv:18956_1_656
I know how you feel. Are you also spoiled by amazone prime?	hit:9478_conv:18956_2_244
Indeed, I thought everything came this early.	hit:9478_conv:18956_3_656
Haha, I know. Especially when I purchase firearms related things like ammunition. It has to ship ground.  1 week for shipping?!?!   rage.	hit:9478_conv:18956_4_244
That sucks! I guess ground shipping takes ages in large countries. 	hit:9478_conv:18956_5_656
Yeah, the US is huge, landmass wise.	hit:9478_conv:18956_6_244
I really really wished it would come today, I was even sat at the window looking for postal trucks and everything!	hit:9478_conv:18956_7_656
You can always leave them an angry review online	hit:9478_conv:18956_8_244
I got so mad at my dog the other day.	hit:9480_conv:18961_1_580
What did your dog do?	hit:9480_conv:18961_2_506
He saw the rabbit that lives under my shed eating some grass in my yard, and decided to scare it and chase it away.	hit:9480_conv:18961_3_580
Oh no, well at least he didnt hurt the rabbit.	hit:9480_conv:18961_4_506
You're right, it could have been much worse. I am thankful in a way.	hit:9480_conv:18961_5_580
I am so upset about what happened yesterday. 	hit:9483_conv:18967_1_147
What happened to you?	hit:9483_conv:18967_2_419
I accidentally can off the road avoiding a deer and totaled my new car.	hit:9483_conv:18967_3_147
That sucks sorry to hear. Are you okay?	hit:9483_conv:18967_4_419
I went to my first concert this weekend I seen Beyonce herself it was so awesome. 	hit:9485_conv:18970_1_284
Oh nice! I bet you'll remember that for a long time	hit:9485_conv:18970_2_234
Yes and I will it was great and her voice and the singers really moved me because even in person it was lovely. 	hit:9485_conv:18970_3_284
I've never been to a concert. I should go see one like you!	hit:9485_conv:18970_4_234
This past weekend I found out a friend of mine I went to school with passed away. He had a heart attack while he slept.	hit:9488_conv:18976_1_340
that's terrible! how does that make you feel?	hit:9488_conv:18976_2_658
It makes me feel old. I mean I am not that old, but to see people my age passing away really makes me think about my own mortality. 	hit:9488_conv:18976_3_340
That is the reality of life, unfortunately! That's what you have to enjoy life now.	hit:9488_conv:18976_4_658
I am upset I have to tell my daughter her pet died.	hit:9489_conv:18979_1_147
That is terrible. How long have you had this pet?	hit:9489_conv:18979_2_7
She had it for 2 years. But I feel I must be honest with her.	hit:9489_conv:18979_3_147
Honesty is vey important. I hope she will not feel too bad.	hit:9489_conv:18979_4_7
I can't believe my husband planned a trip all by him. 	hit:9491_conv:18982_1_147
Where are you going?	hit:9491_conv:18982_2_506
I am still shocked he planned a cruise for 7 days.	hit:9491_conv:18982_3_147
That is going to be so fun!	hit:9491_conv:18982_4_506
I start my diet Monday and let's just say I am not ready to start lol.	hit:9492_conv:18985_1_284
I am never ready. which diet are you trying	hit:9492_conv:18985_2_659
The keto diet and I have started looking up meal preps and workouts but as of non I am so not arranged to start this up I need more time.	hit:9492_conv:18985_3_284
I think my favorite and easiest would have to be Atkins but still alot of prep to get started	hit:9492_conv:18985_4_659
I have to look into that one never heard of it thanks.	hit:9492_conv:18985_5_284
your welcome, and I will check out Keto.	hit:9492_conv:18985_6_659
My dogs are my life more like my family I love them.	hit:9496_conv:18992_1_284
My kitties are my family too. Animals are the best.	hit:9496_conv:18992_2_639
Yes they are you can't be lonely with them they are just so warmhearted and loving always. 	hit:9496_conv:18992_3_284
Exactly! I am glad you have them	hit:9496_conv:18992_4_639
I can't believe my husband hid a talent her had from me for 15 years. 	hit:9499_conv:18999_1_147
That sounds interesting.. What was it? And how did you find out? And why did he hide it! If you don't mind me asking, of course...	hit:9499_conv:18999_2_273
I happen to come across all his drawings. He is as good as most professional artists! 	hit:9499_conv:18999_3_147
Oh I see.. Well that's a pretty positive talent then, huh? Maybe you should encourage him to keep doing it. Maybe he misses it. You could get him a present for his birthday or Christmas that was related to drawing tools/pencils and all that.	hit:9499_conv:18999_4_273
I am starting back dancing ballet next month it's been a while since I last danced. 	hit:9504_conv:19009_1_284
how is that working out for you	hit:9504_conv:19009_2_238
A little rusty but I know when I get in the class and hit the floor with my shoes I am more then positive it will be great.	hit:9504_conv:19009_3_284
practice makes perfect	hit:9504_conv:19009_4_238
I hate I keep receiving double bills every month from Comcast.	hit:9505_conv:19010_1_147
omg i would be upset too... how many times have you called them to fix it? 	hit:9505_conv:19010_2_11
Every month they shut off my service because I didn't pay the second bill. Then I have to go all over this month after month of them fixing their errors.	hit:9505_conv:19010_3_147
Sounds like a nightmare! total. 	hit:9505_conv:19010_4_11
When I see my wedding picture around the house I always think back to that day.	hit:9514_conv:19029_1_13
Does it make you feel happy about your life since then?	hit:9514_conv:19029_2_661
Yeah, just makes me think back to those times and how it was so different from now.	hit:9514_conv:19029_3_13
Well at least you'll always have your memories as time goes on.	hit:9514_conv:19029_4_661
My favorite football team lost their preseason game and I talked so much smack to everyone saying they was going to win. 	hit:9529_conv:19059_1_284
that's why i don't watch sports lol we always make fun of our uncle because he talks a lot of smack and die hard Redskins fan	hit:9529_conv:19059_2_52
I love the Jaguars I was ashamed I talk a lot of smack to everyone lol I guess me and your uncle need to stay quite next time lol.	hit:9529_conv:19059_3_284
lol no! you shouldn't! that's the best part! Talking smack to each other	hit:9529_conv:19059_4_52
You're right I'm going to be even louder next time.	hit:9529_conv:19059_5_284
I dislike a careless driver and this morning I was furious with one by my daughters elementary school. 	hit:9536_conv:19073_1_284
Oh I know how you feel! I wish there was some kind of hotline where you could report a license plate to law enforcement so they would get in trouble for being stupid with kids around	hit:9536_conv:19073_2_227
I wish to and the school zone light was flashing but they was driving past the 15 mph minimum a child could have got hurt.	hit:9536_conv:19073_3_284
Thats awful! People should be arrested for that	hit:9536_conv:19073_4_227
I lost some money yesterday in the parking lot I am still so unhappy about that.	hit:9544_conv:19089_1_284
Oh no!  Devastating! I'm so sorry.	hit:9544_conv:19089_2_438
I know it is I lost $100 and was actually on the way to pay my car insurance with that can't believe I was careless. 	hit:9544_conv:19089_3_284
That makes me feel ill so I'm sure you were sick. I hope somehow you make it up!	hit:9544_conv:19089_4_438
I decided to buy my son's supplies for kindergarten, they wanted very specific brands/counts.	hit:9545_conv:19090_1_26
That could turn out expensive. Did they need a particular brand for a particular reason?	hit:9545_conv:19090_2_656
I'm not sure, it was just on the list.  I had a really hard time finding them.	hit:9545_conv:19090_3_26
That's annoying, maybe they should provide links for you next time?	hit:9545_conv:19090_4_656
I just got out of a job interview for a customer assistant role.	hit:9545_conv:19091_1_656
How did it go?	hit:9545_conv:19091_2_26
I think it went well, apart from a few mistakes, hopefully I got the job.	hit:9545_conv:19091_3_656
That is great.  Interviews are very intimidating. 	hit:9545_conv:19091_4_26
I recently had to babysit my cousins, it was a disaster.	hit:9550_conv:19100_1_656
Oh no, what happened?	hit:9550_conv:19100_2_294
They made a mess everywhere in the house. Really was not a good way to earn money.	hit:9550_conv:19100_3_656
There has o be an easier way.  I have always avoided babysitting because I just don't like other peoples kids that much.	hit:9550_conv:19100_4_294
Yeah, kids are super annoying to deal with, I've learned a lesson, ha!	hit:9550_conv:19100_5_656
Yesterday was my birthday and I knew my girlfriend had a surprise planned for me, but no idea what it would be.	hit:9560_conv:19120_1_580
So i am guessing she gave you a good surprise?	hit:9560_conv:19120_2_68
An awesome one! All my best friends were there and I got some pretty sweet gifts!	hit:9560_conv:19120_3_580
She's must be a keeper then.	hit:9560_conv:19120_4_68
I definitely think so!	hit:9560_conv:19120_5_580
Against all odds, I won two tickets to go to a music festival last summer.	hit:9563_conv:19126_1_580
That is awesome.  I have never won anything in my life.  What festival was it?	hit:9563_conv:19126_2_294
That's a shame! It was a festival called Pooza Fest. Many punk-rock and acoustic shows!	hit:9563_conv:19126_3_580
Congratulations!  Did you have a good time?	hit:9563_conv:19126_4_294
I did, thanks for asking. I went with my older brother and a few of his friends. It was a blast!	hit:9563_conv:19126_5_580
I won a pair of tickets to go to Rockfest this summer.	hit:9567_conv:19135_1_580
wow thats awesome.  How did you win them? I never win anything cool.	hit:9567_conv:19135_2_301
I won them by sharing and liking a facebook page! Unfortunately, none of my friends could go and so I ended up staying home instead.	hit:9567_conv:19135_3_580
aww that stinks, i hope you were at least able to sell them and make some money	hit:9567_conv:19135_4_301
They were tied to my name, so I couldn't even sell them. Oh well!	hit:9567_conv:19135_5_580
My coworker constantly calls in.  The last couple weeks he had only come in on Fridays.  We made a friendly bet last night if he would come in today and I was pretty shocked when he actually was here on a Wednesday.	hit:9570_conv:19141_1_318
That is crazy! How is he still employed?	hit:9570_conv:19141_2_639
He went on disability.  He actually was my old roommate so I know he just doesnt like working but at the same time has anxiety issues so he can go that route to not get fired.  It definitely doesnt look good for him though.	hit:9570_conv:19141_3_318
That makes people look bad. I have severe anxiety and still go to work. I get that things are hard but.... its bad to never come in.	hit:9570_conv:19141_4_639
I told my best friends about an incident in where I self-harmed recently.	hit:9571_conv:19143_1_580
I am glad that you spoke out and shared your feelings. Its not healthy to self harm and pent up your feelings.	hit:9571_conv:19143_2_59
Agreed. I was anxious and scared to share, but I'm glad I did; they were really supportive and it's helped me a lot.	hit:9571_conv:19143_3_580
Thats what best friends are for, after all. I hope things have gotten better for you.	hit:9571_conv:19143_4_59
They have, ever since I started taking meds and speaking to my doctor and social worker. This is also the reason why I think you should confide in a professional, it can really turn your life around and you deserve the best!	hit:9571_conv:19143_5_580
My dog keeps going into my garbage and throwing it all onto the floor!	hit:9573_conv:19147_1_580
Gesh, that's frustrating. I had a dog that used to do that too. Had to get a trash can with a lid.	hit:9573_conv:19147_2_49
That's a good idea, I just haven't found a nice looking one yet. It's really frustrating but I think I'll just get whatever I can at this point.	hit:9573_conv:19147_3_580
We even had to put something heavy on top of the lid to keep it from getting in it. Hopefully that will work for now until you figure something out.	hit:9573_conv:19147_4_49
Thanks for the suggestions, I'm going to give them a shot!	hit:9573_conv:19147_5_580
An eagle landed on my flag pole in my front yard last week!	hit:9574_conv:19148_1_475
That is awe inspiring, very patriotic.  Did you get pictures?	hit:9574_conv:19148_2_294
I did. Not the best pictures because I was using my phone but still, it was really surprising.	hit:9574_conv:19148_3_475
I'm sure, that isn't something you see every day, or would even expect to see ever.  I'm glad you got it documented.	hit:9574_conv:19148_4_294
I've been putting off my exam studying by being productive in other areas of my life.	hit:9576_conv:19152_1_580
Well, that's great. But you probably should study as well. School is very important.	hit:9576_conv:19152_2_469
Yeah... I'm pretty upset in myself for procrastinating, but also proud of what I've been accomplishing. I'm so conflicted in my emotions.	hit:9576_conv:19152_3_580
Yeah, that does sound like a conflicting situation. Well at least you're doing something positive.	hit:9576_conv:19152_4_469
I was helping my girlfriend pack up her sons toys and he had a lite-brite.  I used to have a lite-brite and loved playing with it when I was younger.  It brought back some good memories.	hit:9579_conv:19159_1_318
I bought a lite brite from goodwill about a year ago. It was one of the remakes from recent years but we had fun with it.	hit:9579_conv:19159_2_53
His is a new version too...those toys that were older were sooo much better but at least kids today can have an idea of how awesome they were back then!	hit:9579_conv:19159_3_318
Nope, they only know how to touch screens.	hit:9579_conv:19159_4_53
My girlfriend moved in last weekend.  I really feel like this is the right move for the next steps for us and our relationship.	hit:9583_conv:19166_1_318
That's great! How long have you two been together?	hit:9583_conv:19166_2_545
Almost a year.  We're a little bit older though so I dont feel like its a rush into a relationship sort of thing.	hit:9583_conv:19166_3_318
You learn a lot about someone when you move in with them, so if you feel comfortable in your relationship I think that's actually rather prudent.	hit:9583_conv:19166_4_545
A friend of mine hadn't taken out her garbage in weeks.	hit:9588_conv:19176_1_580
Oh I'll bet that didn't smell pleasant.	hit:9588_conv:19176_2_525
You got that right. Also there were so many fruit flies around it, I felt sick to my stomach.	hit:9588_conv:19176_3_580
Oh gross.  I hope she won't do that again.	hit:9588_conv:19176_4_525
I really hate moving. My girlfriend just moved in last weekend. Im really happy she moved in but Im also SUPER happy that the move is finally over.	hit:9589_conv:19179_1_318
Moving is the worst.  All those boxes.  ugh. i hope i dont have to do it for awhile	hit:9589_conv:19179_2_301
Haha, the boxes are still being unpacked and probably will be for the next couple weeks.  I'm hoping we dont have to again for a while!	hit:9589_conv:19179_3_318
I hope its good that she moved in with you.  things must be serious	hit:9589_conv:19179_4_301

Otakuthon 2018. It was so amazing, I ended up doing really great!	hit:9590_conv:19181_3_580

the one where i was eating ice cream, oh god i miss eating ice cream	hit:9592_conv:19185_3_568

I won't listen to anyone anymore, what i know now is that i trust my guts! that always works out well for me 	hit:9653_conv:19306_1_568
What happened?	hit:9653_conv:19306_2_241
as usual i decided to listen to my father, he told me to come back to my home city and said he has a job there, so i could quit mine, but when i went there he lied, and now i don't have a job	hit:9653_conv:19306_3_568

Not sure if everyone who RSVP'd would show up. People are so flaky these days.	hit:9658_conv:19317_3_259
oh god yes i know what you mean, any ideas what you wanna do ?	hit:9658_conv:19317_4_568

it's not a bad feeling so dont be sorry, it happens every now and then, just makes me realise how grateful i am to be alive	hit:9665_conv:19331_3_568
Oh, I see. I think I kind of understand. It at least sounds like you're a really self-aware person, and appreciative of the small things, and that you have decent perspective on things. The emotions might be difficult to deal with, but at least there are some positives there for you to take stock of	hit:9665_conv:19331_4_273
I almost died today coming home from work.	hit:9670_conv:19340_1_656

You deserve one. Did you get it?	hit:9676_conv:19352_4_548
That's why I'm waiting on it, but I believe that he might have given me it!	hit:9676_conv:19352_5_656
I was driving and someone cut me off in traffic	hit:9680_conv:19360_1_111
I hate it when that happens! Were they driving fast at the time, it could have been quite dangerous.	hit:9680_conv:19360_2_657
Not too fast, it was still irritating though	hit:9680_conv:19360_3_111
I can imagine, at least you got out of the situation safely	hit:9680_conv:19360_4_657

What happened that made you have to do that?	hit:9848_conv:19696_2_56
Just some drunken guy, tried to attack me.	hit:9848_conv:19696_3_326
OH goodness!  Are you ok?	hit:9848_conv:19696_4_56
I knew there is a chance for some sun later in the day, when I went out yesterday.	hit:9849_conv:19698_1_326
I enjoy sunny weather too.	hit:9849_conv:19698_2_322
Yes, how do people live in those cloudy cities like Seattle? 	hit:9849_conv:19698_3_326
They must enjoy the rain.	hit:9849_conv:19698_4_322
I am moving to a different city soon, I feel a bit depressed about that.	hit:9850_conv:19700_1_326
Oh no, I'm sorry hun. I hope you're at least moving for a good reason like better opportunities. 	hit:9850_conv:19700_2_138
Yes, it should at least be better for me financially. 	hit:9850_conv:19700_3_326
Well there is at least one positive. Maybe you could try joining some meet up groups to help you acclimate. 	hit:9850_conv:19700_4_138
Have you ever woken up like like you are ready to conquer the world today?	hit:9851_conv:19702_1_326
I do almost everyday I feel like that is a great mindset to have to make your day successful.	hit:9851_conv:19702_2_284
I am glad we have this in common, many people are so negative in this world.	hit:9851_conv:19702_3_326
They are but to just be able to continue throughout another day is a great feeling.	hit:9851_conv:19702_4_284
I love going to museums and art galleries the art and sculptures is a sight to see. 	hit:9851_conv:19703_1_284
I agree, do you have a favorite artist?	hit:9851_conv:19703_2_326
I love Vincent van Gogh his paintings are so moving and a lot of the art shows are close to his creativeness. 	hit:9851_conv:19703_3_284
Yes, he is great no wonder his work is so expensive.	hit:9851_conv:19703_4_326
I recently had to take a test for work. I knew I would do well because I was prepared.	hit:9852_conv:19705_1_513
That's good. Did you find out the results of the test?	hit:9852_conv:19705_2_366
Not yet. I should find out within the next week.	hit:9852_conv:19705_3_513
Good luck on the exam! 	hit:9852_conv:19705_4_366
Some things in my life can only be described by word - providence. 	hit:9853_conv:19706_1_326

Okay, tell me more about that.	hit:9853_conv:19706_4_322
I feel happy for my brother that he is a good photographer.	hit:9854_conv:19708_1_326
That's great. Does he do photography as a job or a hobby?	hit:9854_conv:19708_2_286
Just as a hobby. But he's good at it.	hit:9854_conv:19708_3_326
Maybe he can turn it into a career and make a lot of money!	hit:9854_conv:19708_4_286

Our family dog was stolen a week ago and our home haven't been the same.	hit:9865_conv:19731_1_284
Wow what kind of dog did you lose?	hit:9865_conv:19731_2_375
A teacup yorkie I miss her so much I have been so heart broken since they stole her while we was out shopping. Had to be someone who was watching us and waited until we left. 	hit:9865_conv:19731_3_284
That's so tragic I have 3 dogs myself, do you have flyers up?	hit:9865_conv:19731_4_375
Yes I do but no call backs yet wish we had a chip in her.	hit:9865_conv:19731_5_284
My girlfriend's cat randomly walks over my head in the middle of my sleep.	hit:9866_conv:19732_1_580
Oof, I hope that doesn't wake you up	hit:9866_conv:19732_2_247
It does, and I get so upset. Apparently she doesn't ever do it to my girlfriend, only when I come over.	hit:9866_conv:19732_3_580
Maybe it doesn't fell very comfortable with having you over and doesn't have any other way of expressing itself	hit:9866_conv:19732_4_247
My girlfriend and I have birthdays 8 days apart.	hit:9871_conv:19743_1_580
that's cool.  Do you celebrate both of them on the same day?	hit:9871_conv:19743_2_389
We do! Exchanging gifts makes it feel like Christmas in the summer and it made me so happy.	hit:9871_conv:19743_3_580
haha I bet.  That's pretty awesome!  	hit:9871_conv:19743_4_389
So today I let my co worker draw my blood knowing she is a novice!	hit:9876_conv:19753_1_567
oh no. did something bad happen?	hit:9876_conv:19753_2_27
It actually went well. I felt I could give her the benefit of the doubt considering she has been doing really well recently. 	hit:9876_conv:19753_3_567
That;s great. I have always been nervous no matter who drew my blood.	hit:9876_conv:19753_4_27
I agree! I',m the same way, but even more since she is new, but I had confidence in her 	hit:9876_conv:19753_5_567
She is going to be great at that job	hit:9876_conv:19753_6_27
Yeah she is. I knew the manager done well when she hired her and this proves it. I know I can wean her from shadowing me now. 	hit:9876_conv:19753_7_567
I went to call a patient back to be seen and I addressed them as Mrs and the person that walked up was a male. 	hit:9880_conv:19761_1_567
Oh no. How'd they react?	hit:9880_conv:19761_2_1
He didnt get upset.. He said it happens alot, but I can feel my face get red!	hit:9880_conv:19761_3_567
I'd be super embarassed, too!	hit:9880_conv:19761_4_1
Yes it was very embarrassing! we both laughed at it. 	hit:9880_conv:19761_5_567
My dad came home from a bar really drunk one night, and started instigating fights with everyone in the household.	hit:9881_conv:19762_1_580
Wow, that's horrible, I hope he calmed down after and apologized to everyone	hit:9881_conv:19762_2_247
Unfortunately, no. Despite him scaring everyone, he did not care.	hit:9881_conv:19762_3_580
Yikes, I would definitely stage an intervention with the rest of your family, let him understand it's not okay	hit:9881_conv:19762_4_247
I agree, I wish it were that easy. At least he's cut down on the excessive drinking and we get along kind of fine now. It's better than nothing right?	hit:9881_conv:19762_5_580
When I was a kid, my friends brought their BeyBlades to school to play	hit:9883_conv:19767_1_580
I remember those	hit:9883_conv:19767_2_27
They were awesome and I wanted one so badly, but my parents could not afford it. I felt very bitter towards my friends for a while after.	hit:9883_conv:19767_3_580
I never had one. I didnt know they were expensive	hit:9883_conv:19767_4_27
I had my review today at work! It went really well since the doctor has been giving me compliments!	hit:9885_conv:19771_1_567
That's great! I hope you keep getting good reviews like that.	hit:9885_conv:19771_2_1
Yeah im very happy to know what comes next, since I will find out how much of a raise I will get from this. I cant wait!	hit:9885_conv:19771_3_567
That's awesome. How much do you anticpate the raise to be?	hit:9885_conv:19771_4_1
Im hoping alot, but Im overjoyed about it!	hit:9885_conv:19771_5_567
My girlfriend recently found herself a new hobby in sewing	hit:9891_conv:19782_1_580
oh thats cool, is she good ?	hit:9891_conv:19782_2_238
She's super talented. She made a few dresses and cosplay within a month. 	hit:9891_conv:19782_3_580
oh thats cool	hit:9891_conv:19782_4_238
Yeah! I was surprised she could pull it off in such a short time.	hit:9891_conv:19782_5_580
I put a lot of effort and time into getting into a college program I wanted to be in.	hit:9893_conv:19786_1_580
oh that sounds like it will be very rewarding!	hit:9893_conv:19786_2_559
Unfortunately, I had to switch majors; the program was too difficult to stay in and my mental health was deteriorating.	hit:9893_conv:19786_3_580
a tough situation but at least you were able to realize and adapt!	hit:9893_conv:19786_4_559
My sister leaves her clothes all over the living room.	hit:9897_conv:19795_1_580
Oh god. The living room is shared. She should just leave the messiness in her room.	hit:9897_conv:19795_2_1
I agree completely! I get so irritated and I always tell her to clean up after herself, but she seems so very lackadaisical. 	hit:9897_conv:19795_3_580
How old is she?	hit:9897_conv:19795_4_1
She just turned 18, so there's really no excuse.	hit:9897_conv:19795_5_580
My girlfriend's cat is sick with Cancer.	hit:9898_conv:19796_1_580
I'm so sorry to hear that. How old is the cat?	hit:9898_conv:19796_2_1
Only a couple of years old. It's so upsetting to think that she won't make it for much longer.	hit:9898_conv:19796_3_580
All you can do is make sure she's not in too much pain as she goes.	hit:9898_conv:19796_4_1
Last night my date decided to keep checking out the hot girl at the table next to us. 	hit:9906_conv:19812_1_567
I hope you walked out right then and there!	hit:9906_conv:19812_2_1
I didnt. I kept on with the date. She was very pretty and well dressed. She drove a nice care. I was kind of envious of it. 	hit:9906_conv:19812_3_567
ah that was really disrespectful of her though. That's not someone you'd want to date long term.	hit:9906_conv:19812_4_1
Yeah i agree. At the moment I was just envying her look. I wish I could have what she did. 	hit:9906_conv:19812_5_567
The new girl at work is doing really well considering she has not experience. I'm shocked!	hit:9910_conv:19820_1_567
That is good to hear. She should be a big help a lot quicker than normal then.	hit:9910_conv:19820_2_56
I agree! Everyone including me were quite shocked byt it. 	hit:9910_conv:19820_3_567
That should bode well for her and her future there though, so it was a good surprise!	hit:9910_conv:19820_4_56
Yes it was. We all didnt think she woudl do well so fast. Took us by suprise. 	hit:9910_conv:19820_5_567
After a year of being single I decided to start dating again. 	hit:9916_conv:19833_1_567
How has it been going?	hit:9916_conv:19833_2_4
Its very boring since Im usally home by myself alot. NOw that Iim starting to date it wont be so boring. 	hit:9916_conv:19833_3_567
That is good, hopefully you find your soulmate.	hit:9916_conv:19833_4_4
Yes I agree. I live alone and are new to the city so it can be very boring. 	hit:9916_conv:19833_5_567
A tiger decided to act crazy at the zoo yesterday while the ring leader was doing a performance on stage!	hit:9922_conv:19845_1_567
Oh god. Did anything happen?	hit:9922_conv:19845_2_1
Everybody was screaming and leaving the place! It was very scary for everyone! I didnt stay to find out. 	hit:9922_conv:19845_3_567
Well, I hope nothing bad happened!	hit:9922_conv:19845_4_1
I agree. I bet the little kids have never seen nothing like this. How horrible!	hit:9922_conv:19845_5_567
I watched Wimbledon for the first time. Those tennis players are so good!	hit:9923_conv:19846_1_513
I watched it too! My favorite is Federer. Who is yours?	hit:9923_conv:19846_2_209
I like watching Serena Williams. Do you watch every summer?	hit:9923_conv:19846_3_513
I have for the past 10 years! It's one of my favorite sports to watch.	hit:9923_conv:19846_4_209
My yearly review is coming up and I have been doing well this year. 	hit:9925_conv:19851_1_567
That's great. Do you thiink you will get a raise?	hit:9925_conv:19851_2_27
I really think I will. I dont expect less than that. I have confidence in it. 	hit:9925_conv:19851_3_567
Confidence is super important	hit:9925_conv:19851_4_27
I agree. I have no doubt it will go well. 	hit:9925_conv:19851_5_567
good luck. even though you don't need it	hit:9925_conv:19851_6_27
Thanks! I feel and have confidence it will be a good raise!	hit:9925_conv:19851_7_567
My boyfriend came home from his trip early. I wasn't expecting him home for another two days!	hit:9928_conv:19856_1_513
That's great! You must be happy!	hit:9928_conv:19856_2_1
I was! It was very unexpected and exciting. Although, I was hoping to have time to clean the place up before he got home.	hit:9928_conv:19856_3_513
How come he came home early?	hit:9928_conv:19856_4_1
I took my neice to volunteer at a homeless shelter this past weekend. She showed alot of compassion and love for the homless and needy. 	hit:9929_conv:19859_1_567
That's really thoughtful of you. Do you typically do things like that?	hit:9929_conv:19859_2_209
Well I volunteer to help abused and battered kids. I wanted to show her things like this. I know she can be a good loving person. 	hit:9929_conv:19859_3_567
Perhaps I should find the local shelter in my community and do the same. I have never done that before and I feel like I should be giving back to those less fortunate in some capacity.	hit:9929_conv:19859_4_209
It makes you feel very good with yourself to be able to do things like this. I love and cherish those moments. 	hit:9929_conv:19859_5_567
My boyfriend came home from his trip two days early! 	hit:9934_conv:19869_1_513
Yay! Do you guys have free time to spend together now?	hit:9934_conv:19869_2_247
Yes. I'm very excited since I haven't seen him in two weeks.	hit:9934_conv:19869_3_513
That sounds great, you should make him dinner to surprise him back!	hit:9934_conv:19869_4_247
I was so upset today because 2 people decided to block traffic because of an argument. 	hit:9941_conv:19882_1_567
How long did that last for?	hit:9941_conv:19882_2_4
for a good 45 minutes. At that it was during rush hour. everybody was so mad at them. 	hit:9941_conv:19882_3_567
Why didn't you tell them to move?	hit:9941_conv:19882_4_4
We all were honking and yelling at them, but they didnt pay no mind. How inconsiderat of them. 	hit:9941_conv:19882_5_567
A few years back I moved to a new state.  Now my childhood best friends and I live in different parts of the country and I don't know anyone really where I am.	hit:9942_conv:19884_1_403
You must really miss them.	hit:9942_conv:19884_2_1
I really do.  I mean we're in constant contact over the internet through instant messaging and video calls.  But it's not often that we all can get together and see each other in person.	hit:9942_conv:19884_3_403
Yea. Seeing each other on a screen definitely can't beat being with each other in person.	hit:9942_conv:19884_4_1
Definitely.  We've talked about making plans to visit each other but it's hard to find the time to organize it.	hit:9942_conv:19884_5_403
My boyfriend unexpectedly came home from his trip two days early!	hit:9944_conv:19889_1_513
did he catch you doing something crazy?	hit:9944_conv:19889_2_27
No, thankfully I was just eating. 	hit:9944_conv:19889_3_513
Thats good lol	hit:9944_conv:19889_4_27
My coworkers last day of work was today. Im so upset she is leaving. 	hit:9946_conv:19893_1_567
That's so sad. Do you have any other friends there?	hit:9946_conv:19893_2_209
Yeah i do, but she was the one I was closest to. Yes I was very sad.	hit:9946_conv:19893_3_567
I am so sorry for you. Perhaps you can hang with her after your workdays?	hit:9946_conv:19893_4_209
Yeah maybe we can do that. Its not the same though. 	hit:9946_conv:19893_5_567
I cant wait for Friday! I go on vacation to New York!	hit:9948_conv:19897_1_567
New York is a fun place to visit.	hit:9948_conv:19897_2_4
I agree. I never been there so Im so happy!	hit:9948_conv:19897_3_567
You will have a blast.	hit:9948_conv:19897_4_4

So my hair dressed ruined my hair! Im so mad!	hit:9952_conv:19904_1_567
Oh no! was it too short for your liking?	hit:9952_conv:19904_2_247
Actually I had to shave my head off. She used new product that burnt my hair! 	hit:9952_conv:19904_3_567
Yikes! I would ask for a refund for sure	hit:9952_conv:19904_4_247
Yes! Im so mad at her. She knows better! I cant beleive this!	hit:9952_conv:19904_5_567
So I lost 20 lbs onmy diet and last night I ate a whole large pizza!	hit:9953_conv:19907_1_567
Wow! Well a cheat day here and there might be okay! Haha	hit:9953_conv:19907_2_332
I agree. I feel bad for doing so!	hit:9953_conv:19907_3_567
Right, but I'd say once isn't too bad as long you stay on track.	hit:9953_conv:19907_4_332
I agree. Ill do my best not too. I feel horrible eating a whole pizza. I will pay for it tomorrow. 	hit:9953_conv:19907_5_567
I remember when my friends were helping me move out of our hometown.  We were riding in the moving truck and it came time to drop them off and say goodbye.  We all felt terrible.	hit:9954_conv:19908_1_403
I would feel terrible too. Where did you move to?	hit:9954_conv:19908_2_209
I moved to a town about 30-45 minutes away, but at that point we were so used to seeing each other every day of our lives.  It was hard to get used to.	hit:9954_conv:19908_3_403
I've moved almost half a dozen times in my life before, so I completely understand. Those were rough times.	hit:9954_conv:19908_4_209
Yeah, it's always a big hassle having to pick up and go like that.  There's so much to take care of and do before you make the actual move.	hit:9954_conv:19908_5_403
The manager the store was very mean and rude to the employees. I could not beleive it. 	hit:9959_conv:19918_1_567
That sucks, imagine being in an environment like that all day, I would go crazy	hit:9959_conv:19918_2_247
I agree. It made me sick to my stomach seeing it. I feel bad for them!	hit:9959_conv:19918_3_567
I guess some people are just really rude, no matter what position you put them in	hit:9959_conv:19918_4_247
Yeah. It makes me wanna puke thinking about how mean he was!	hit:9959_conv:19918_5_567
Last night my GPS asked me to make a right down a dark and scary road. 	hit:9966_conv:19933_1_567
It's hard to trust a GPS. I have heard a lot of stories about people being steered the wrong way. Please tell me you didn't do it.	hit:9966_conv:19933_2_548
I was very nervous and doubting to do it. I actually did and it wasnt that bad	hit:9966_conv:19933_3_567
I am so glad that it didn't turn out bad for you. 	hit:9966_conv:19933_4_548
Me too. At first I wasnt going to, but I didnt want to get lost. 	hit:9966_conv:19933_5_567
I finally told my friend I was into him. He didnt take it too well. 	hit:9969_conv:19939_1_567
what did he do , how did he react ?	hit:9969_conv:19939_2_650
He rejected me and told me not to every call him again. Im so embarrassed. I should have known better. 	hit:9969_conv:19939_3_567
Well he is the one missing out and  i'm sure your very worthy of attention from some better.	hit:9969_conv:19939_4_650
Maybe. I just feel bad and embarrassed about it. I should known better not to mess up our friendship. 	hit:9969_conv:19939_5_567
Last night my neice placed 5th at her dance performance. She was so upset and so was I	hit:9974_conv:19948_1_567
Why was she upset? Depending on how many people entered, fifth could be really good.	hit:9974_conv:19948_2_513
There were 30 girls. We worked very hard and felt she would place top 3 but what an outcome it was to be 5th. 	hit:9974_conv:19948_3_567
That's still really good! She did better than 25 other people. 	hit:9974_conv:19948_4_513
I agree.Im proud of her, but she was very upset at the judges. 	hit:9974_conv:19948_5_567
I am very excited to not have any plans this weekend. It's going to be so nice to relax for two whole days.	hit:9974_conv:19949_1_513
NIce! I bet you cant wait! Do you anticipate to releax or do things to catch up?	hit:9974_conv:19949_2_567
Just relaxing this weekend. 	hit:9974_conv:19949_3_513
Very nice! I bet its going to be a good happy weekend. 	hit:9974_conv:19949_4_567
My best friend has won those Taco Bell Playstation 4 giveaways twice so far.  I wish I could be that lucky sometimes.	hit:9976_conv:19952_1_403
Dang, and here I thought I was lucky winning a free soft drink in that contest. Maybe we have to pool our efforts together and try to win us something big?	hit:9976_conv:19952_2_209
I know, man just got together and buy like 50 boxes and cross our fingers.  And another thing was he got it on his first try both times.	hit:9976_conv:19952_3_403
Why stop at 50? We ought to get 100! We need to show your friend and evil corporate Taco Bell who is boss and nab us some consoles!	hit:9976_conv:19952_4_209
Haha, that's the spirit!  Win us some systems, sell them off and use the money to buy more boxes.	hit:9976_conv:19952_5_403
My nephew asked me to use my car this weekend for a drivers ed class. 	hit:9977_conv:19955_1_567
Did you let him?	hit:9977_conv:19955_2_56
We have been practicing together in my car , so I feel I can let him. 	hit:9977_conv:19955_3_567
You are good to allow him to borrow the car.	hit:9977_conv:19955_4_56
Yeah. I feel he wont let me down. 	hit:9977_conv:19955_5_567
Im planning on going sky diving this weekend! 	hit:9978_conv:19956_1_567
Wow, I really like to do that. I hope you will enjoy it..	hit:9978_conv:19956_2_43
I dont know. I hate heights, so im very nervous about it	hit:9978_conv:19956_3_567
Ah ok. If you try once you will be alright next time..	hit:9978_conv:19956_4_43
I dont think I will ever not be scared of heights. The thought of it makes me have the chills!	hit:9978_conv:19956_5_567
My roommate leaves leftovers in the fridge and they get moldy.	hit:9979_conv:19958_1_513
That sounds revolting! Have you said anything to him about it?	hit:9979_conv:19958_2_209
No. I'm not very confrontational. And our lease is up in two months anyway so I'm just going to wait it out.	hit:9979_conv:19958_3_513
That sounds like a good plan. Perhaps you should request a formal resume from any potential roommates for your future abode.	hit:9979_conv:19958_4_209
I was at the library today and was trying to study, but this lady across the table was smacking her gum very loud. 	hit:9984_conv:19968_1_567
Did you ask her to stop it or did you have to move away from her?	hit:9984_conv:19968_2_56
well the library is very small so limited seats so I had to sit there and listen to it. I was so frusterated	hit:9984_conv:19968_3_567
That was very rude of her to do that, some people just have no manners.	hit:9984_conv:19968_4_56
Yah I agree. I could understand if it was not so quiet and an open place. I can still hear it in my ear now!	hit:9984_conv:19968_5_567
So this weekend Im going to do a marathon. I have worked very hard to get myself ready for it	hit:9986_conv:19972_1_567
That's so exciting! Have you run a marathon before?	hit:9986_conv:19972_2_513
I never have. I think all this time I been practicing will pay off.	hit:9986_conv:19972_3_567
That's good, I hope you do well! How did you prepare?	hit:9986_conv:19972_4_513
I joined cross fit and did alot of cardio work outs.I think this helped me for it.	hit:9986_conv:19972_5_567
My boyfriend came home from his trip two days early! 	hit:9986_conv:19973_1_513
What a nice surprise! Did something happen or did he miss you!?	hit:9986_conv:19973_2_567
His business trip wrapped up a few days earlier than planned.	hit:9986_conv:19973_3_513
I see.I bet you and him are happy to be able to spend a little time together. 	hit:9986_conv:19973_4_567
I doubt I will get any sleep waiting for tomorrow.	hit:9990_conv:19980_1_147
I'm sorry to hear. Why is that?	hit:9990_conv:19980_2_209
I am finally getting to take the kids to Disneyland! 	hit:9990_conv:19980_3_147
Oh, well that is a fine thing indeed! I would be  jumping up and down!	hit:9990_conv:19980_4_209
 I had to go out of town by myself for three weeks. It was hard not being able to talk to anyone I knew. 	hit:9992_conv:19984_1_513
Sounds pretty lonely. Did you meet or make some friends while out of town?	hit:9992_conv:19984_2_567
No, I was too busy focusing on work while I was there.	hit:9992_conv:19984_3_513
Ah I see. Staying focused is hard, especially when your lonely.	hit:9992_conv:19984_4_567
My neice didnt get into nursing school.She worked so hard for this. I feel bad for her.	hit:9992_conv:19985_1_567
That's horrible! Is she going to try again?	hit:9992_conv:19985_2_513
Yeah she is. She is going to retake some classes she made a B in. The look on her face after she found out was pricelss.	hit:9992_conv:19985_3_567
It must have been awful to see that in someone you care about. I'm glad she's not giving up.	hit:9992_conv:19985_4_513
yeah thats what i said. Its like the world ended when she found out, but she is doing better now.	hit:9992_conv:19985_5_567
I cant wait for this weekend! Im leaving for New York!	hit:9993_conv:19987_1_567
wow , thats great. You must be loving it	hit:9993_conv:19987_2_43
Yeah I cant wait. I never been, so I cant sleep thinking about it.	hit:9993_conv:19987_3_567
You must get a good sleep now to enjoy the New york later	hit:9993_conv:19987_4_43
Yeah Im going to try, but its so exciting and my nerves are everywhere!	hit:9993_conv:19987_5_567
My coworkers and I got $200 dollars worth of lottery tickets. 	hit:9997_conv:19994_1_567
Nice! Were they scratch offs?	hit:9997_conv:19994_2_209
For the powerball. We are all crossing our fingers!	hit:9997_conv:19994_3_567
I will cross mine too! I hope ya'll win it big.	hit:9997_conv:19994_4_209
WE hope we do to!	hit:9997_conv:19994_5_567
Last night while driving home I fell asleep at the wheel. 	hit:9998_conv:19996_1_567
OMG....that had to be so scary.	hit:9998_conv:19996_2_548
Yes it was. My phone rang and thats what woke me up. Im so lucky to be here today. 	hit:9998_conv:19996_3_567
I am so glad that you are. Now no more driving when your sleepy.	hit:9998_conv:19996_4_548
Yeah im very thankful I didnt crash last night. 	hit:9998_conv:19996_5_567
My upstairs neighbors make a ton of noise at all hours of the night. It makes it difficult for me to sleep. 	hit:10001_conv:20003_1_513
That really sucks. Maybe you should try egging their door? Or just break in and pretend you're bigfoot while they're trying to sleep.	hit:10001_conv:20003_2_209
I'm not trying to get arrested! I think I'll just wait things out until I move in two months.	hit:10001_conv:20003_3_513
I would go with the bigfoot option. You can get a costume on the cheap on ebay nowadays. I've used that tactic countless times and it has never failed!	hit:10001_conv:20003_4_209
Im expecting a good bonus to be on this check coming up. I can finally go buy a new car!	hit:10003_conv:20007_1_567
That is some exciting news. Do you already know what kind of vehicle you want?	hit:10003_conv:20007_2_548
Yes! Very exciting! Yes I had my eye on one all year. I cant wait	hit:10003_conv:20007_3_567
Christmas is coming early. You will have to take me for a ride.	hit:10003_conv:20007_4_548
I studied so hard and prepared for this exam tomorrow. I bet I will make no less than an A	hit:10004_conv:20009_1_567
I am sure you will. Good luck for you!!	hit:10004_conv:20009_2_43
Thanks! It will be a breeze. 	hit:10004_conv:20009_3_567
Whats kind of exam is that?	hit:10004_conv:20009_4_43
Statistics exam. I aced this class for sure. There's no doubt in my mind. 	hit:10004_conv:20009_5_567
I've got a big test coming up and I'm so worried!	hit:10007_conv:20015_1_513
Don't be. i think you will ace it.	hit:10007_conv:20015_2_43
I hope so. I usually do better than I expect to, but that still doesn't make it any less scary.	hit:10007_conv:20015_3_513
exam's are always scary. we just need to take the mind out of it	hit:10007_conv:20015_4_43
My bank has called me three times a day ever since I applied for a mortgage. It's been a week and they show no signs of slowing down. 	hit:10010_conv:20020_1_513
Why not block the calls?	hit:10010_conv:20020_2_4
I want them to be able to get in touch with me if something important comes up.	hit:10010_conv:20020_3_513
Have you asked them to stop calling about this topic?	hit:10010_conv:20020_4_4
My upstairs neighbors make a ton of noise at all hours of the night. It makes it difficult for me to sleep.	hit:10012_conv:20025_1_513
Have you spoken to him?	hit:10012_conv:20025_2_4
No, I don't like to be confrontational. I'm moving in two months anyway, so I'm just going to wait it out.	hit:10012_conv:20025_3_513
Maybe you should buy some earplugs.	hit:10012_conv:20025_4_4
I watched Wimbledon on TV over the summer for the first time. Those tennis players are so good!	hit:10019_conv:20039_1_513
I love tennis. Will you watch the US Open?	hit:10019_conv:20039_2_4
Maybe. I hadn't considered it yet.	hit:10019_conv:20039_3_513
It is a great tournament, you should watch.	hit:10019_conv:20039_4_4
My bank has called me three times a day ever since I applied for a mortgage. It's been a week and they show no signs of slowing down.	hit:10026_conv:20052_1_513
So are they telling you good news?	hit:10026_conv:20052_2_366
Not yet. I just filled out the prequalification online. I haven't officially applied yet.	hit:10026_conv:20052_3_513
Oh okay. Well hopefully they give you a chance to breathe and decide what you want to do.	hit:10026_conv:20052_4_366
My mom said she was going to make me a mystery dinner. I believe in her!	hit:10033_conv:20066_1_547
Ooh how nice! Do you have any guesses as to what she may be making you?	hit:10033_conv:20066_2_302
Nope! She was going to make something completely different from what she usually makes!	hit:10033_conv:20066_3_547
Well I hope it's good! Your mom sounds like a great person to have a fun surprise for you like that.	hit:10033_conv:20066_4_302
I met my wife online 7 years ago and can't see myself with anyone else, ever.	hit:10036_conv:20073_1_475
You are so lucky to find someone special online. That can turn out so badly sometimes for some people. 	hit:10036_conv:20073_2_346
Oh I know. I got lucky, we found out we lived really close to each other so we met up and it has been great ever since.	hit:10036_conv:20073_3_475
That sounds like fate? Being that both of you lived close to each other.	hit:10036_conv:20073_4_346
My daughter has worked very hard to keep her school work finished, her room clean, and the dishes washed. I bought her a cell phone for her birthday this year. She is becoming a responsible young preteen	hit:10044_conv:20088_1_607
Wow, watching kids grow up is hard. How has she been with the cell phone?	hit:10044_conv:20088_2_544
"She has been good so far. We are trying to limit her access to it to just a few hours per day. She also had to ""turn it in"" at night before she goes to bed."	hit:10044_conv:20088_3_607
That's great parenting! You have to trust that your children will make the right choices.	hit:10044_conv:20088_4_544
Yes, you do! Hopefully she keeps doing the right thing with it	hit:10044_conv:20088_5_607
I am sure with your guidance she will!	hit:10044_conv:20088_6_544
I have been having some anxiety lately and made an appointment with a psychiatrist. I kept going back and forth about if I wanted to actually go	hit:10048_conv:20097_1_607
You should go, Otherwise the condition could get worse.	hit:10048_conv:20097_2_673
I ended up going. I'm really glad I did. She has been a HUGE help for me.	hit:10048_conv:20097_3_607
That is great news! fortunately doctors are there to help us and i'm glad they have helped you!	hit:10048_conv:20097_4_673
I had a septic tank issue and called a guy that I found a business card from and had him come out. He didn't have hardly any equipment with him and sounded like he didn't know what to do.	hit:10057_conv:20114_1_475
Oh my goodness that sounds so bad! Did they charge you for the visit?	hit:10057_conv:20114_2_302
No. I just asked what it would cost to fix then told him I couldn't afford it to get him to leave. 	hit:10057_conv:20114_3_475
You made the right move. They at least have to show up with that giant truck that sucks the tank dry.	hit:10057_conv:20114_4_302
I bought a big bag of M&Ms and I could not resist it	hit:10058_conv:20116_1_675
If I had a bag of M&M's right now I would eat them for sure!	hit:10058_conv:20116_2_659
well that is what I just did, so far I have eaten half of it	hit:10058_conv:20116_3_675
maybe save the other half for later. lol.	hit:10058_conv:20116_4_659
I do not think I can and feel ashamed that I cannot resist it	hit:10058_conv:20116_5_675
That's ok, it happens to us all. Tomorrow is a new day.	hit:10058_conv:20116_6_659
I told my girlfriend about my self harm habits a little while ago.	hit:10067_conv:20135_1_580
How did she reacted to the admission to self harm? 	hit:10067_conv:20135_2_346
She was really sad, but she appreciated the fact that I told her. 	hit:10067_conv:20135_3_580
Now that your girlfriend knows the problem,  the both of you can work on solutions and support together.	hit:10067_conv:20135_4_346
My friends wanted to bring me to laser quest for my birthday.	hit:10068_conv:20136_1_580
Is that like a laser tag place? That sounds like a lot of fun! What do you think?	hit:10068_conv:20136_2_302
Yeah exactly. I wasn't sure if I'd like it or not and I was a little unwilling to try it out. 	hit:10068_conv:20136_3_580
I've played laser tag a few times. I think you will have a great time! It's very high paced and noisy but that's half the fun.	hit:10068_conv:20136_4_302
I spent all of summer doing everything but studying for my final exam	hit:10069_conv:20138_1_580
Oh that sounds worrisome, do you think you will pass?	hit:10069_conv:20138_2_128
I'm fairly certain I'm going to fail and I feel awful about myself, but I just can't get myself to do it.	hit:10069_conv:20138_3_580
I'm sad to hear that but human nature is hard to fight. Honestly, if you have any alternative options or plans you may have to fall back on them.	hit:10069_conv:20138_4_128
My friends and I had spent all day troubleshooting a new PC build that we had just completed.	hit:10070_conv:20141_1_580
That sounds intensive! How did it go?	hit:10070_conv:20141_2_302
It went awful. It turned out that the motherboard or processor were defective and we had to deconstruct it to return both pieces. So much wasted time!	hit:10070_conv:20141_3_580
I bet that was so defeating! I'm sorry to hear that. I wish there was better quality control with some of these companies that deal in parts.	hit:10070_conv:20141_4_302
It really was. At least my friend learned a lot about computers as we built it together!	hit:10070_conv:20141_5_580
That's a good bright side to look at.	hit:10070_conv:20141_6_302
I found an injured spider with a leg missing in my bathroom a few days ago.	hit:10071_conv:20142_1_580
Did you save it or kill it?	hit:10071_conv:20142_2_673
I saved it. I brought it outside and hoped for the best.	hit:10071_conv:20142_3_580
It's missing a leg so its probably dead unfortunately.	hit:10071_conv:20142_4_673
I passed two trials that a company put me through and I only have three left.	hit:10072_conv:20145_1_580
ooh, I bet you can't wait to finish!	hit:10072_conv:20145_2_659
You got that right! I'm feeling pretty happy about my performance and I think I'll get the job!	hit:10072_conv:20145_3_580
I hope you get it! Good luck!	hit:10072_conv:20145_4_659
I spent hours studying for a final exam.	hit:10074_conv:20148_1_580
How did they go? Did you pass?	hit:10074_conv:20148_2_673
It went amazing! I expected to pass but I didn't think I'd get a 91!	hit:10074_conv:20148_3_580
Wow! congrats, you should totally be proud of yourself.	hit:10074_conv:20148_4_673
I found an old stamp booklet my girlfriend and I filled out before we started dating.	hit:10075_conv:20151_1_580
That's very sweet! I bet it brought up a lot of feelings inside you.	hit:10075_conv:20151_2_302
 Definitely. I felt so warm and fuzzy on the inside, and so did she when I sent her a snapchat of it.	hit:10075_conv:20151_3_580
You guys sound like you have a solid relationship. It's always great to find those little pieces from the early days.	hit:10075_conv:20151_4_302
I'm pretty sure a girl at the convention was hitting on me.	hit:10077_conv:20154_1_580
Did you get her number?	hit:10077_conv:20154_2_673
Nah. I have a loving girlfriend and I would never cheat on her.	hit:10077_conv:20154_3_580
Good man, I have a lot of respect for that.	hit:10077_conv:20154_4_673
For my camping trip, I brought with me my tent, camping chairs, mattress, sleeping bag, pillows, med-kit, bug spray, food and beer.	hit:10078_conv:20156_1_580
That sounds like quite the checklist. I'm glad you brought the beer you might need it haha!	hit:10078_conv:20156_2_302
Oh yeah definitely. Never have I ever felt so ready for anything in my life.	hit:10078_conv:20156_3_580
Well I bet you're going to have a great time. With that haul I don't see how you couldn't!	hit:10078_conv:20156_4_302
I saw a man slap his dog on the sidewalk a few times while I was on the bus.	hit:10080_conv:20160_1_580
Holy cow! Did you call him in?	hit:10080_conv:20160_2_305
I should have, but last time my girlfriend did that the police ignored it. I was so angry.	hit:10080_conv:20160_3_580
Oh man!  Do you have a dog?	hit:10080_conv:20160_4_305
I do, and I couldn't fathom how someone could do that. I wanted to hop off the bus and yell at the guy.	hit:10080_conv:20160_5_580
I just had to replace one of the window panes in my house.	hit:10080_conv:20161_1_305
How come? And was it a pain to replace it?	hit:10080_conv:20161_2_580
I'm not sure what happened.  I had to have a guy come out to replace it, and couldn't meet him, so my wife had to.	hit:10080_conv:20161_3_305
I hope he did a good job!	hit:10080_conv:20161_4_580
My said he did!  I had quite a bit of confidence in him, based on others' feedback.	hit:10080_conv:20161_5_305
Awesome, I'm glad to hear that. Sometimes it's hard to find contractors with good reputation.	hit:10080_conv:20161_6_580
When I was a kid, all my friends had Yu-Gi-Oh cards but me.	hit:10081_conv:20162_1_580
How come you didn't collect them? i loved them myself.	hit:10081_conv:20162_2_673
I think my parents found them expensive, otherwise I can't think of any other good reason. To be honest, I kind of envied my friends.	hit:10081_conv:20162_3_580
Well, they are expensive and you didn't really miss much.	hit:10081_conv:20162_4_673
In that case, I feel much better haha.	hit:10081_conv:20162_5_580
I took up running and I started seeing a huge improvement in my cardiovascular endurance.	hit:10083_conv:20167_1_580
Nice, Was it hard to start?	hit:10083_conv:20167_2_673
Unimaginably hard. But once I got into it I couldn't stop. I'm feeling pretty certain that I'll hit my 5km goal in no time.	hit:10083_conv:20167_3_580
Wish i could run close to 5km, i'd struggle with 100 meters.	hit:10083_conv:20167_4_673
I used to be that guy too. If I can do it, you can do it.	hit:10083_conv:20167_5_580
My younger brother was playing an old Gamecube game that I loved to play back when I was a kid.	hit:10084_conv:20168_1_580
That's cool. Man, those tiny disks were easy to lose. what game?	hit:10084_conv:20168_2_290
He was playing Paper Mario and the Thousand Year Door. What an awesome game! It brought back so many great memories.	hit:10084_conv:20168_3_580
That's awesome. I get nostalgic about old games as well. 	hit:10084_conv:20168_4_290
My buddy drank way too much at a party and puked all over my favorite jacket.	hit:10086_conv:20173_1_580
That sounds horrible, Did you wash it or throw it away?	hit:10086_conv:20173_2_673

Did you stay for long? That would be a great vacation. 	hit:10106_conv:20213_4_410
We stayed for only 4 days because it cost us about $200 each for four days and nights, but I hope we can book it for a whole week or two next summer.	hit:10106_conv:20213_5_580
What a great time! Is the cottage on a lake?	hit:10106_conv:20213_6_410

It's wonderful peace of mind to find someone you can trust with your fur babies! Did you have a nice trip?	hit:10124_conv:20249_2_104
Yes, I was able to go visit my stepdaughter on the other side of the country. The sitter sent pictures occasionally, so I didn't spend my trip worrying.	hit:10124_conv:20249_3_573

How did it go? What'd you get him for a gift?	hit:10128_conv:20256_2_302
He got a remote control excavator, and had a lot of fun at his party.  It's crazy how fast he's growing up, though.	hit:10128_conv:20256_3_305

I don't have the motivation. I know the workouts I should be doing but also struggle with proper form a bit.	hit:10138_conv:20277_3_580

We all need someone to just listen once in awhile.|what was wrong with it|That is a good thing then|Wow, you're smart and kind! I wouldn't know where to start re. building a computer. Well done!|Well I think as long as you say sorry, she can forgive.|The cat didn't like you, oh dear. I am so sorry that happened. You need to spend more time with the cat.|Absolutely|right now it's freezing in my home lol I just got out of bed after 30 mins of sitting because it's coold|That is terrible, he could have hurt the horse!|oh god, how did you . have the courage to even go outside?|aww that stinks, i hope you were at least able to sell them and make some money|Have you been a long time runner before that?|To be fair, everybody makes mistakes and it's bound to happen even to the best of us!|Wow, that should have been amazing|Did you catch anything?|Oh no, poor dog :( I'd be devastated too, i love dogs so much.|You have a test coming up?|What did she surprise you with?|That's exciting! When will she be moving in?|Haha, same! Just one more hour for me. Hope you can enjoy it soon!|The way you wrote that makes it seem like you're anticipating something bad... Do you mind if I ask what you're expecting to happen?|What restaurant is it for? |Yeah I hear you! Do you like to read or watch TV?|That  sucks.  I'd be very upset.      You have to be careful who you order from online.  Some times if the price is too goot to be true its a fake product.|That's amazing. You must have been so surprised and happy!|Oh wow. That's pretty scary. I would be horrified.|I don't know what I would have done|I was very nervous. I did not know if I would pass or not.|Sorry, that was an error!

Im so sorry to hear that.  Why would she do that?|That sounds very frustrating.|How are you celebrating it?|Yeah, I can understand that. Sometimes when you're not in a position to enjoy yourself because you're busy being tied down with responsibilities, it's easy to get mad at others. Whatever you can do to spin it positively, I would suggest that. Being negative about it will only make everyone's lives worse.|Im sorry to hear that it can be hard ;/|That is a relief. Sounds like you made it just in time.|It's been really rainy. My power just went out awhile ago.|That's good, I love relaxing outside by a pool.|How so?|That is amazingly lucky! good for you!|That is a tough thing to deal with but hopefully his first F will also be his last.|I'm sorry to hear you're having to deal with that|Best way to ensure your food is clean and free of hair cook it yourself.|OH NO!

That probably means you worked on it until it became something you're proud of.|I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you don't have to work through the weekend!|Well, maybe yours. Mine just want to sit inside and play on their phones all day.|That's a great asset to have emotionally I think.|If you share the fridge, I'd let her know if it causes an odor or might affect the other food.|I don't know what I would do without my dog.  I'm glad you have one that's always there for you!|That is SO exciting! Congratulations!

I hope you get it. When do you hear?|Thank God you will be able to tell them in person about how much you miss them|Wow, that's horrible, I hope he calmed down after and apologized to everyone|Thats never good when you have a bad manager.  What made them so bad?|If it were me, I'd call the animal shelter and report possible abuse since the dog does nothing but bark all day - poor thing just needs attention and the owner isn't taking care of it.|That sounds very exciting! What kind of planning did you put into such an achievement?|Oh no!  That is horrible!  Is he OK?

Its always best to be on time , I hope they understand no one is perfect.	hit:10186_conv:20372_4_650
I agree. I feel so bad and embarrassed about it. Even the doctor scolded me. 	hit:10186_conv:20372_5_567
My boss told me to go to school to become a doctor instead of a nurse. I felt like it was a compliment. Im worried about how much and how long medical school will take.	hit:10188_conv:20377_1_567

Yeah. I want to stay true to my beliefs, but she made some very valid points. 	hit:10190_conv:20380_3_567
OK,  so what is your plan now? 	hit:10190_conv:20380_4_686
I will do research about her theories and then make really think about sticking to my beliefs. 	hit:10190_conv:20380_5_567

Wow that sounds scary. Did you make good friends?	hit:10196_conv:20393_2_687
Yes, I did eventually. There's something to be said for living in a dorm at a time when you want to meet new people and fit in.	hit:10196_conv:20393_3_573
Yes it can be really helpful! I went to school 3 hours from my home and it was still hard to meet new people	hit:10196_conv:20393_4_687

Yeah I felt bad. She started crying so much. Its like her world ended there.	hit:10197_conv:20395_3_567

I bet it does! Do you go by there often?	hit:10199_conv:20398_2_688
I get to visit about once a year. I always wish that I knew who lived there now so I could see the inside of the house.	hit:10199_conv:20398_3_573
I bet it's much different than it was back when you lived there.	hit:10199_conv:20398_4_688

I'm going to have to at least try. Maybe they'll be understanding and let me attempt again.	hit:10211_conv:20423_5_599

They were angry and wanted to be aggressive. 	hit:10214_conv:20428_3_549
Definitely doesn't excuse what they did.	hit:10214_conv:20428_4_599

Oh no, was it one of those meetings that should have been an email?	hit:10220_conv:20440_2_138
It definitely was, so I ended up skipping it.	hit:10220_conv:20440_3_305
Hopefully you don't get in trouble but I definitely know the feeling. 	hit:10220_conv:20440_4_138
I regretted skipping the meeting a little bit, but probably not as much as if I'd gone to it.	hit:10220_conv:20440_5_305
I told my close friend a very big secret yesterday.	hit:10223_conv:20447_1_599
Oh really, were you supposed to tell them?	hit:10223_conv:20447_2_628
It was my choice. I really don't think they'll tell anyone! They're good people.	hit:10223_conv:20447_3_599
You can never be to sure now a days, they might post your secret to social media.	hit:10223_conv:20447_4_628

Yeah, but I haven't had one in 3 years.	hit:10225_conv:20450_3_305
Word, you should ask him what the secret is	hit:10225_conv:20450_4_437
I was totally committed to him in every way I could be.   HOwever he ended up cheating on me	hit:10234_conv:20469_1_587
That kind of cold disregard for someone you're supposed to love is totally alien to me, the guilt would destroy me.	hit:10234_conv:20469_2_691
It would me too, not only that but he just up and got with her like I never existed to him.   Its funny because he always accused me of cheating on him and I had no clue why.  It was him the whole time!	hit:10234_conv:20469_3_587
Yeah Freud called it Projection, it's too bad people tend to hide their true natures so well.	hit:10234_conv:20469_4_691
He kept doing drugs, and taking things that didnt belong to him.  It broke my heart but I didnt know what else to do.	hit:10236_conv:20472_1_587
It's awful! I know so many families are dealing with similar situation. Sometimes we don't know how to help someone close to us. Heart breaking...	hit:10236_conv:20472_2_684
Yes you are right about that.  I dealt with it for a long time and then I just couldn't anymore.  Over and over things would disappear and he would of course always deny it.  He became violent at time to his sister and me and I couldn't put them at risk.	hit:10236_conv:20472_3_587
You can't help him until he wants to really change. Sometimes all you can do is pray.	hit:10236_conv:20472_4_684

One time I went into the public restroom and saw poop smeared everywhere! Ew!	hit:10256_conv:20513_1_547
I think I would leave if I saw something like that.	hit:10256_conv:20513_2_694
I left as fast as possible!	hit:10256_conv:20513_3_547
Did you tell someone about it so they could take care of it?	hit:10256_conv:20513_4_694
Nope, just you!	hit:10256_conv:20513_5_547
It seems most responsible to alert someone to clean it.	hit:10256_conv:20513_6_694
One time I was so nervous to look at my grade for my final exam	hit:10258_conv:20517_1_547
I feel that way sometimes when I check my bank account, how's school going?	hit:10258_conv:20517_2_437
I failed and dropped out! Now I live in my parents house doing nothing all day	hit:10258_conv:20517_3_547
Word, college is tough, wishing you the best	hit:10258_conv:20517_4_437
like who on earth writes var int value = 1, this is so ridiculous i am so annoyed at my brother, after everything i tought him, he doesn't even know the basics 	hit:10260_conv:20520_1_568
 and got upset with you?	hit:10260_conv:20520_2_696
no i was the one who was upset with him	hit:10260_conv:20520_3_568
 And why do not you try to teach your brother?	hit:10260_conv:20520_4_696
PROGRAMMING!	hit:10260_conv:20520_5_568
i am working so hard, that i can see a pile of money building up for my future 	hit:10261_conv:20523_1_568
Good for you!  I hope it does not stress you out, though.	hit:10261_conv:20523_2_694
it doesn't i am taking regular breaks	hit:10261_conv:20523_3_568
That is good.  Money is no good if you are not healthy enough to enjoy it.	hit:10261_conv:20523_4_694
One time I saw a creepy person run towards me in the night out in the streets	hit:10262_conv:20525_1_547
Dang, how fast did you run away?	hit:10262_conv:20525_2_437
I froze up because I was terrified. It was just my brother though	hit:10262_conv:20525_3_547
Did you tell him how creepy he is lol	hit:10262_conv:20525_4_437
While I was packing my stuff to move, I found Old high school pictures. It made me think of all the good times  I had.	hit:10267_conv:20534_1_567
That is awesome, what types of photos did you find? Anything funny or silly? 	hit:10267_conv:20534_2_631
Well more of my old best friend. I have not seen her i a long time.We went through alot together. It was nostalgic to me. 	hit:10267_conv:20534_3_567
Aww yeah, those are great times that you can never really go back to. Sometimes I also wish I could go back in time...maybe you could call her up again and catch up on the last few years! 	hit:10267_conv:20534_4_631
I agree! We have alot of things to catch up on. 	hit:10267_conv:20534_5_567
being alive is so much stress and anxiety, why does it have to be like this? why can't we just all express our individual selves, instead we are forced to work so that we can eat 	hit:10272_conv:20545_1_568
It's not fair, eh. Having to suppress those feelings day in and day out is significantly harder than the mundane work itself. At least it's comforting know that most everyone feels the same? 	hit:10272_conv:20545_2_666
Yes, it's true we all know this inside out, but we still continue to work on our meaningless lives, the funny thing is we all know but no one is acting, if we all acted we would be living in a much more beautiful and free life, not one which just gives the impression of freedom, that's all there is now, faking but i guess the one thing that is true is my feelings	hit:10272_conv:20545_3_568
Maybe if we weren't so attached to being creatures of comfort. Some things we just can't let go of, wouldn't exist without some poor shmuck having to do the dirty work. I guess we're all that shmuck to someone, someway or another.	hit:10272_conv:20545_4_666
I watched a movie the other night that really got me in my feelings.	hit:10273_conv:20546_1_599
Oh wow, what ovie was it and how did it make you feel? 	hit:10273_conv:20546_2_631
I don't remember the name. I was watching it with a friend and they put it on but it was about a son who found his birth mother after many years apart.	hit:10273_conv:20546_3_599
oh wow that sounds very emotional, I think I would have needed a bucket to catch all my tears. 	hit:10273_conv:20546_4_631
i am so disappointed in myself, i could have do so much better at work but i guess it wasn't my day, i was not able to focus	hit:10275_conv:20550_1_568
I liked my friend very much and believed that he can not talk negatively about me	hit:10275_conv:20550_2_699
what makes you so sure? anything can happen i mean just look at murphy's law 	hit:10275_conv:20550_3_568
May be you are right. But sometimes, you go with your heart not with the law. Murphy's law may not work in every situation.	hit:10275_conv:20550_4_699
My grandma ended up getting really sick this last week.	hit:10276_conv:20552_1_599
Oh no, I am sorry to hear that. How is she doing and how are you holding up? 	hit:10276_conv:20552_2_631
She is getting much better. My family and I did everything we could to take care of her.	hit:10276_conv:20552_3_599
That is great that she has such a great support group and loving family members to support her. I hope she gets well soon! :)	hit:10276_conv:20552_4_631
i feel so guilty, my sister crying because 'someone eat her cake' that she had been saving for 2 days now, and that someone was non other than me...	hit:10277_conv:20554_1_568
Oh no, maybe buy her a new cake to make it up to her!	hit:10277_conv:20554_2_631
oh wow you are such a genius! why didn't i think of that before... there is always a bright side to everything	hit:10277_conv:20554_3_568
Yes there is! Maybe throw in a cupcake too, I am sure she will forgive you in a heart beat! I know I would. :) 	hit:10277_conv:20554_4_631
words cannot describe how happy i am, in 2 weeks time i will go and see my wife i am so joyful and exciting 	hit:10279_conv:20558_1_568
I am so happy for you! Why have you been apart for the past two weeks?	hit:10279_conv:20558_2_630
no we live in a long distance relationship (not for long though) so it's hard for me to see her, but i will be able to see her after 6 months apart  	hit:10279_conv:20558_3_568
Awesome to hear that you'll get to live with your loved one soon	hit:10279_conv:20558_4_630
I had a terrible experience at the grocery store today.	hit:10281_conv:20562_1_599
Oh no what happened, are you alright? 	hit:10281_conv:20562_2_631
Yeah, I'm alright. But I dropped a jar of pasta sauce and it ended up shattering. Sauce got all over the floor.	hit:10281_conv:20562_3_599
Oh no that must have been a terrible experience, I hope no one got hurt from the shattered glass.	hit:10281_conv:20562_4_631
I aced all my classes this semester, so Im hoping and thinking my GPA will be a 4.0	hit:10282_conv:20564_1_567
That's what I like to hear! What changes did you make this semester to achieve your possible 4.0?	hit:10282_conv:20564_2_323
I actually gave more effort this semester, so I will continue to do goo and hope to get into nursing school next year.	hit:10282_conv:20564_3_567
wow. that's awesome! you'll need  that work ethic in nursing school for sure.	hit:10282_conv:20564_4_323
I agree. Im planning and hopping things go well.	hit:10282_conv:20564_5_567
So everything for a party im throwing this weekend is ready and everything is paid for. I have it ready last week so I wouldnt stress.	hit:10284_conv:20569_1_567
It sounds like you're quite the organized person!	hit:10284_conv:20569_2_395
Yea. I like to have things ready and done prior to make sure everything goes well.	hit:10284_conv:20569_3_567
I'm the same way a lot of the time. It's really a good way to avoid any unnecessary disasters.	hit:10284_conv:20569_4_395
Im going to ask my girlfriend to marry me this weekend! I have no doubt in my mind she will say no	hit:10286_conv:20573_1_567
That is so exciting! Best of luck to you man! I doubt she would reject such a great guy like you. :) 	hit:10286_conv:20573_2_631
Thanks! I think we are doing well so i wont be disappointed or sidetracked by a no from her.	hit:10286_conv:20573_3_567
That is great, I would also be surprised if she said no to a man like you! 	hit:10286_conv:20573_4_631
i am so afraid... afraid that i am not giving too much to the world, what if i parish not having done anything?	hit:10287_conv:20575_1_568
I wouldn't worry too much about it. None of it really matters, if we make a difference or not, we all end up dust in the end.	hit:10287_conv:20575_2_138
no, i don't believe that, whether you are having a bad day or not if you look at everything clearly you will see there is a next stage, just like birth death is a process	hit:10287_conv:20575_3_568
If telling yourself that makes you feel better, I found all of that to be much more stressful. To be completely honest with you I think people invented stories about the after life to make them more comfortable with death.	hit:10287_conv:20575_4_138
Not necessarily,  while it's true you have your traditional christian or Muslim that preach the afterlife as some miracle and hell, scaring people into not being themselves, but death isn't a scary phase, and i don't care about whether i am going to die, as that is just the ego trying to cling on and survive, i've passed that point, but after looking clearly you'll see there is more than just this dimension and that is just a simple fact, science tells us this too, it's not about feeling good or feeling comfortable with death, it's about growing 	hit:10287_conv:20575_5_568
the world is such a disgusting place now, i wish i was born back in the 70s 	hit:10291_conv:20583_1_568
Yeah, 70s were incredible, the dancing the cars, the women had style and the music was incredible.	hit:10291_conv:20583_2_628
RIGHT?! but now is just so bad, i wish i could go back	hit:10291_conv:20583_3_568
But we got to make the best of it, pretty soon elon musk will release flying cars and then life will be amazing again.	hit:10291_conv:20583_4_628
today everyone said congratulations to me, as i succeed in making an amazing app, and now i am so greatful to be alive! 	hit:10292_conv:20584_1_568
Congratulations on your success! I bet you worked incredible hard to achieve your goals.	hit:10292_conv:20584_2_182
thank you! it's always nice to tell you these things, you don't get jealous and you are just happy for me, thank you	hit:10292_conv:20584_3_568
There will always be people that are jealous of your success, but it is up to you to be the bigger person and handle it with grace.	hit:10292_conv:20584_4_182
I came home from work today to a disaster. My dog chewed up the new couch i just purchased.	hit:10293_conv:20586_1_567
Oh no, can you return it or get a refund?	hit:10293_conv:20586_2_631
No I didnt purchase insurance. When i saw it my blood was boiling!	hit:10293_conv:20586_3_567
I am sorry to hear that, I would have felt the same way. 	hit:10293_conv:20586_4_631
yeah. Im so upset i cant even think right nowl	hit:10293_conv:20586_5_567
I gave my dog away to a family today. I did not have time for him since work and school take alot of it up.	hit:10294_conv:20588_1_567
That has got to be rough. At least it has a home now that hopefully has more time.	hit:10294_conv:20588_2_599
I agree, but im praying they will take care of him. hes just a puppy.	hit:10294_conv:20588_3_567
I'm sure they will be great to him and he'll bring them joy as well!	hit:10294_conv:20588_4_599
Yeah thats all i can ask for.	hit:10294_conv:20588_5_567
I saw my girlfriend getting real friendly with another guy at the bar last night	hit:10294_conv:20589_1_599
OH no! Are you the jealous type?	hit:10294_conv:20589_2_567
It definitely had me feeling a little uneasy about the whole situation.	hit:10294_conv:20589_3_599
OH man! Yeah I would of felt the same way!	hit:10294_conv:20589_4_567
I have a test coming up next week.	hit:10296_conv:20593_1_599
oh no do you feel ready for it? 	hit:10296_conv:20593_2_631
I'm super ready for it! I spent so much time studying over the last week.	hit:10296_conv:20593_3_599
That is great, I believe that you will do amazing! 	hit:10296_conv:20593_4_631
I AM SO ANNOYED! i have been trying to solve this math problem for 2 hours now	hit:10297_conv:20594_1_568
Oh that sounds really annoying. maybe you can look it up online or get someone to help?	hit:10297_conv:20594_2_77
there isn't any solution it's a century award i am working on, it's the problem of non-polynomial descent 	hit:10297_conv:20594_3_568
Oh I see, well good luck to you, I hope you'll solve it soon.	hit:10297_conv:20594_4_77
I'm really feeling alright about how my life is going right now.	hit:10299_conv:20599_1_599
That is great, what has been going on in your life recently?	hit:10299_conv:20599_2_631
I've just been getting things done. Nothing has been going amazing but nothing really sucks either.	hit:10299_conv:20599_3_599
That is good, sometimes that is all you really need to do, get things done  one step at a time :) 	hit:10299_conv:20599_4_631
The ads for the new World Of Warcraft expansion really makes me think about when I played it many years ago.	hit:10304_conv:20608_1_599
They looked really exciting! Does it make you want to play it again?	hit:10304_conv:20608_2_182
It does. I put so much time in that game before. I might have to pick it up again.	hit:10304_conv:20608_3_599
If it makes you happy then you should do it! Capitalize on that nostalgic feeling while you can.	hit:10304_conv:20608_4_182
I woke up to something super annoying this morning.	hit:10309_conv:20619_1_599
That is always frustrating. What happened?	hit:10309_conv:20619_2_182
I woke up to find out my car was sideswiped while it was parked by the curb during the night. No note or anything.	hit:10309_conv:20619_3_599
Wow, some people are just terrible! I hate when people don't take responsibility for their actions.	hit:10309_conv:20619_4_182
I'm really disappointed in my son's actions that I was told about.	hit:10311_conv:20623_1_599
What did he do?	hit:10311_conv:20623_2_666
He got caught cheating by his teacher on a test the other day.	hit:10311_conv:20623_3_599
Oh no. What do you think caused him to do that?	hit:10311_conv:20623_4_666
Probably because he did not study enough so was unprepared.	hit:10311_conv:20623_5_599
I ate such a disgusting thing the other day by accident.	hit:10312_conv:20625_1_599
What was it that you accidentally ate?	hit:10312_conv:20625_2_395
I bought a sandwich and after a few bite I noticed that there was a bunch of mold.	hit:10312_conv:20625_3_599
Eww that sounds horrible! Were you able to get a refund at least?	hit:10312_conv:20625_4_395
I was!	hit:10312_conv:20625_5_599
I recently had my first child.  I was absolutely terrified when I went into labour but I put all my faith in the wonderful midwives and everything worked out perfectly!	hit:10314_conv:20629_1_208
I'm glad it went as planned. I can imagine that to be a very stressful moment.	hit:10314_conv:20629_2_666
it really was its just so scary but I had to believe the experience and caring nature of the midwives would get my through it and it did.  I really admire anyone in that career, its not just a job but a vocation.	hit:10314_conv:20629_3_208
You've really got to be committed to go into work like that. It's not for everybody, I agree.	hit:10314_conv:20629_4_666
Indeed.  The really do work with life and death everyday.	hit:10314_conv:20629_5_208
I started a diet today and just as soon as I get home I eat a burger!	hit:10315_conv:20631_1_567
I know how hard diets are to stick to. What foods are you avoiding?	hit:10315_conv:20631_2_701
Fried foods. I feel bad I didn't commit to it the first day. 	hit:10315_conv:20631_3_567
Don't be too hard on yourself, it's hard to quit something immediately. Just keep trying, I believe in you!	hit:10315_conv:20631_4_701
Thank you! I need that motivation so I can get over this shame im feeling. 	hit:10315_conv:20631_5_567
I get it. There is always another meal to start making the change!	hit:10315_conv:20631_6_701
I'm so not looking forward to tomorrow.	hit:10316_conv:20633_1_599
Why not? What happens tomorrow?	hit:10316_conv:20633_2_395
I have to talk to a large group at work tomorrow. 	hit:10316_conv:20633_3_599
Don't let it worry you too much. Just make sure you organize everything you need to present and remember to speak loudly and clearly! You can do it!	hit:10316_conv:20633_4_395
I changed my shift to overnight and walking to my care gave me the creeps tonight. There was a man standing in the dark.	hit:10317_conv:20635_1_567
That sounds creepy! Is there any chance someone could start escorting you to your car? There is strength in numbers!	hit:10317_conv:20635_2_395
I agree. I had goosbumps all over and chills down my spine. 	hit:10317_conv:20635_3_567
I definitely recommend getting some mace and a pocket knife. Stay safe out there!	hit:10317_conv:20635_4_395
My brother is going into surgery tomorrow.	hit:10318_conv:20637_1_599
I hope that all goes well. I am sure he will be good as new after!	hit:10318_conv:20637_2_64
I'm really hoping so! I've been really worried.	hit:10318_conv:20637_3_599
I am sure the procedure will go excellently.	hit:10318_conv:20637_4_64
Today my friend had all of is awe, becasue she won the singing contest at work. She is so shy and no one would have ever known she could sing. 	hit:10320_conv:20640_1_567
That's really cool! I bet people really underestimated that underdog!	hit:10320_conv:20640_2_395
I agree! I was amazed with her performance. She did really well.	hit:10320_conv:20640_3_567
That's awesome! Maybe she'll come out of her shell.	hit:10320_conv:20640_4_395
I hope so. She is very talented. Who would have known. 	hit:10320_conv:20640_5_567
I have such a fear of flying, so you can just imagine how I felt when my husband bought us a sky diving voucher for my 30th birthday! He was so excited and I was so nervous and uneasy.	hit:10321_conv:20643_1_208
He's a brave man. How was the experience?	hit:10321_conv:20643_2_701
Well the day came and off we travelled.  We arrived at the place only to find all our friends and family there to cheer us on.  Up we went in the plane and of course while the lovely instructors tried to reassure me the whole time, i tried desperately to keep my breakfast down!  However after the nerves and initial panic when we jumped out, it was actually one of the most amazing experiences of my life!	hit:10321_conv:20643_3_208
It sounds incredible! Hopefully it helped you conquer your fear!	hit:10321_conv:20643_4_701
It certainly did.  I would definitely recommend it.  My husband though is another story.  He has a fear of the sea and underwater so you can just guess what I will be buying him for his next big birthday haha.	hit:10321_conv:20643_5_208
I was so worried that I could not pay for my tuition this semester. Thankfully my boss decided to give us a big bonus. 	hit:10324_conv:20649_1_567
Congratulations! Worrying about tuition is the absolute worst panic!	hit:10324_conv:20649_2_395
Yeah and its the last one before I graduate! I can be more thankful for his generosity. 	hit:10324_conv:20649_3_567
You're going to kill it this semester! You're going to be so proud when you're walking down the aisle to get handed your degree.	hit:10324_conv:20649_4_395
Thanks for the kind words. I cant be more happy and excited to be done!	hit:10324_conv:20649_5_567
I was doing a big clear out recently and stumbled accross my old high school year book.  It is a long time since I left school and couldnt believe I even still had it.  Such a feeling of nostalgia looking at the old photos and reading the stories.	hit:10328_conv:20657_1_208
Did you guys write still write notes in each others' books in high school?	hit:10328_conv:20657_2_701
Yes!  I laughed and sometimes cried a bit reading through those, especially from some old friends that are no longer with here.  It even brought up some great memories of prom and our school leaving party.	hit:10328_conv:20657_3_208
It's amazing how many feelings and memories mementos like that can bring back.	hit:10328_conv:20657_4_701
Indeed.  It definitely made my clear out day much more enjoyable.	hit:10328_conv:20657_5_208
So i just bought a brand new corvette and I let my friend barrow it to go out of town. 	hit:10330_conv:20660_1_567
That's awesome! Hopefully it comes back in one piece.	hit:10330_conv:20660_2_64
I agree! She will take care of it. I have faith she will bring it back the way she got it! lol	hit:10330_conv:20660_3_567
I think it will be fine. I bet the new car runs well.	hit:10330_conv:20660_4_64
Yeah it does. I never let anybody drive my car, but I felt I could let her since she is responsible. 	hit:10330_conv:20660_5_567
My husband wont be back for a month due to work and Im here at the house by myself.	hit:10331_conv:20662_1_567
Im sure that is tough.  You must really miss him.	hit:10331_conv:20662_2_208
Yeah i have no pets or children so im just here in an empty house. 	hit:10331_conv:20662_3_567
Do you get nervous being on your own?	hit:10331_conv:20662_4_208
Nah just bored. Im new to this city so I dont know anybody either. 	hit:10331_conv:20662_5_567
Oh that sounds even tougher.  It is a long time but I hope it flies by for you and your hubby is back home again.	hit:10331_conv:20662_6_208
Yea I agree! II feel so helpless being home by myself. 	hit:10331_conv:20662_7_567
Im sure your not though! 	hit:10331_conv:20662_8_208
I had the worst experience last weekend.  I woke up to find someone had stolen my car! I was in absolute shock just couldnt believe it.	hit:10331_conv:20663_1_208
Thats horrible! Did you get the police involved?	hit:10331_conv:20663_2_567
Well yes.  While i was in my daze, absolutely horrified, my level headed husband did all the practical things like contact the police and insurance company etc.	hit:10331_conv:20663_3_208
Yeah i would have felt the same way. 	hit:10331_conv:20663_4_567
Thankfully the insurance company sorted my out with a courtesy car for now but still cant believe there are people out there that do such terrible things!	hit:10331_conv:20663_5_208
yeah it unfortunate we have to worry about things like this.	hit:10331_conv:20663_6_567
true but in time I finally did see that its not the end of the world, its just a car that can be replaced but that initial overwhelming feeling was awful.	hit:10331_conv:20663_7_208
Today after a long day at work I sat in traffic for 2 hours due to construction on the freeway!	hit:10333_conv:20667_1_567
That's a ton of traffic. I hope they finish their project soon	hit:10333_conv:20667_2_64
Me too! I get so frusterated because there are no back roads to my house so I have to go through this for the next 2 weeks. 	hit:10333_conv:20667_3_567
That's unfortunate. I wish we could fly sometimes.	hit:10333_conv:20667_4_64
Me too, so i wouldn't have to deal with wasted time!	hit:10333_conv:20667_5_567
My old friend suprised me with a phone call today. I have not heard from her since high school. 	hit:10334_conv:20668_1_567
How lovely!  I such it was so nostalgic to talk about old times together.	hit:10334_conv:20668_2_208
Yes it was. I cant wait for our reunion so we can catch up on more!	hit:10334_conv:20668_3_567
That is a brilliant idea.  There is nothing better than catching up with old friends.	hit:10334_conv:20668_4_208
Yes the things we remember and ponder about are the greatest!	hit:10334_conv:20668_5_567
A little stray pup appeared on my driveway yesterday.  My initial reaction was to contact the local pet shelter.  However no one had reported him.  I decided to take him in, wash him and feed him.  I have never been much of an animal person but I couldnt believe how much i felt for this poor wee puppy.	hit:10334_conv:20669_1_208
Awe your such a caring and loving person! Are you going to keep it?	hit:10334_conv:20669_2_567
I didnt think I was but he has won my heart.  No one claimed him, even after posters being put around so yes he has officially become part of the family.  To be honest I was glad no owner came forward, I would never have wanted to give him up in the end he has just stolen my heart!	hit:10334_conv:20669_3_208
The love and care you show him will bring him joy and happiness! 	hit:10334_conv:20669_4_567
Just as he does to us.	hit:10334_conv:20669_5_208
I got super wasted. I accidentally messed myself in front of people	hit:10338_conv:20676_1_607
Oh wow, that must've been a hard situation. Especially later when you were more in control again.	hit:10338_conv:20676_2_77
Yeah. That was the day I decided to no longer drink	hit:10338_conv:20676_3_607
That sounds like a good decision. Good luck!	hit:10338_conv:20676_4_77
I'm really excited for this next weekend!	hit:10339_conv:20678_1_599
What's happening this weekend? I hope you have some good things planned.	hit:10339_conv:20678_2_381
A friend that has been living overseas for the last year or so is going to come back to visit finally!	hit:10339_conv:20678_3_599
That's awesome! I'm very excited for you this is a good event for you!	hit:10339_conv:20678_4_381
I had a really scary experience the other day.	hit:10341_conv:20682_1_599
That's interesting. Are you okay?	hit:10341_conv:20682_2_64
Yeah, I'm fine. My friend got into a car crash while I was in the car though.	hit:10341_conv:20682_3_599
That's bad news. I hope that everyone is healthy and doing well.	hit:10341_conv:20682_4_64
I went camping the other day and had a rlly bad experience during it.	hit:10342_conv:20684_1_599
Why what happened?	hit:10342_conv:20684_2_208
I ended up getting lost for a bit in the woods which was not fun. Luckily, I made it back to my group at some point.	hit:10342_conv:20684_3_599
Oh sounds scary!  I would have been scared.	hit:10342_conv:20684_4_208
When I was a teenager I used to borrow my big sisters clothes without her knowledge.  One time she had just bought a lovely new dress after saving all her wages.  That weekend I borrowed it and of course ripped it!  The next day when she found out she was so angry and i felt terrible.	hit:10342_conv:20685_1_208
Oh no! I hope she's forgiven you since then.	hit:10342_conv:20685_2_599
oh yes she has, it was a while ago now but at the time the guilt was awful.  Needless to say I learnt my lesson and never borrowed her clothes again!	hit:10342_conv:20685_3_208
That's probably a good idea.	hit:10342_conv:20685_4_599
Yes just a pity I had to learn the hard way.	hit:10342_conv:20685_5_208
My last day of work was yesterday. I got so emotional driving home and I cried.	hit:10343_conv:20687_1_567
I'm sorry to hear you were upset! Why did you have to quit?	hit:10343_conv:20687_2_435
Im going back to school full time. I was there for more than 10 years. I will miss everyone. 	hit:10343_conv:20687_3_567
Wow that is a long time! Hopefully you can stay in touch with all of your former coworkers.	hit:10343_conv:20687_4_435
Yeah just thinking about it makes me want to tear up. 	hit:10343_conv:20687_5_567
Yesterday I found my boyfriend with someone else!	hit:10344_conv:20689_1_567
hmmn, really?..i guess you must have felt very bad	hit:10344_conv:20689_2_191
I was gonna explode. Im so fed up with him. Im so done.	hit:10344_conv:20689_3_567
am so sorry about that, did he apologize?	hit:10344_conv:20689_4_191
He doesnt know I know, but he will soon when i throw his stuff out	hit:10344_conv:20689_5_567
One time when I was younger I wore a Halloween costume that I'd been looking forward to show off.  But I ended up covering myself up with a cape, because I was self conscious of how I looked.	hit:10372_conv:20745_1_403
Aww- I'm sorry that happened. Why were you embarrassed?	hit:10372_conv:20745_2_211
Well the costume itself ended up looking great, since my mom made it.  But I hadn't realized how fat I looked when i wore it, so I felt bad.	hit:10372_conv:20745_3_403
It's always difficult when you feel self-conscious - but I've learned that people rarely judge you as hard as you judge yourself. 	hit:10372_conv:20745_4_211
That's true, but no matter how much I tell myself that I always end up thinking about it too much about it.  I'm constantly worrying about what people think of me.	hit:10372_conv:20745_5_403
Please try to be kinder to yourself! You are a great person- with a lot to offer. Always remember to be good to yourself.	hit:10372_conv:20745_6_211
Whom do you belive the most	hit:10373_conv:20747_1_508
In reference to what?	hit:10373_conv:20747_2_435
Your trustful person?	hit:10373_conv:20747_3_508
My husband is my most trusted companion.	hit:10373_conv:20747_4_435
Oh, How much did you like him	hit:10373_conv:20747_5_508
my father couldn't stope any lower, how can someone take money from their own child	hit:10384_conv:20768_1_717
That's horrible! I'm a parent and I could never take money from my child. Did you confront him?	hit:10384_conv:20768_2_211
i did many times, but he threatens to kick me out and ruin everything	hit:10384_conv:20768_3_717
How frustrating! Keep your head held high and be strong. One day you'll be able to keep him from taking your money.	hit:10384_conv:20768_4_211
my wife is always there for me, so i trust her more than anybody and i dont want to have any friends otehr than her, she is my faith	hit:10385_conv:20771_1_717
That's really nice, however, to keep the marriage fresh and strong, I think it's important for you to have outside friends.	hit:10385_conv:20771_2_577
that's only normie talk, we are both introverted and we hate people	hit:10385_conv:20771_3_717
Haha, well I do know the feeling. I guess if it works for you, then don't change anything.	hit:10385_conv:20771_4_577
i am a joke, i am ashemed of what i did	hit:10387_conv:20774_1_717
what did you do???	hit:10387_conv:20774_2_563
i builied someone because they made fun of my mother, but the person had difficulties walking already and i buillied i can't believe i did that	hit:10387_conv:20774_3_717
well im sure you'll get over it. nobody should make fun of our mothers	hit:10387_conv:20774_4_563
I  waited 3 years for them to realise season 3 and they promised it was to be released today, i was so devastated when i found out that they had to postpone it even more :/ it's just so annoying	hit:10391_conv:20783_1_717
stay hopeful! , they'll release it sooner or later	hit:10391_conv:20783_2_706
i hope so :<	hit:10391_conv:20783_3_717
it's all gonna be fine and you'll get what u want.	hit:10391_conv:20783_4_706
I still have a favorite stuffed animal of mine that I've had since I was young.  It's still in pretty good condition and reminds me a lot of my childhood.	hit:10399_conv:20798_1_403
That is so sweet. It is wonderful to have things that bring back these beautiful memories. 	hit:10399_conv:20798_2_409
Yeah, it is.  I always like to keep things that mean a lot to me and this was a gift from my mom so it's even more special.	hit:10399_conv:20798_3_403
That really does make it special. I'm glad you have that. 	hit:10399_conv:20798_4_409
a young girl, crying, sadden by the cruelity of our elders, told me about all these feelings i began to cry and became very sentimental	hit:10400_conv:20800_1_717
....what feelings? what are you talking about	hit:10400_conv:20800_2_563
she said that the elder man approached her and told her she is dumb and that made her very sad and upset	hit:10400_conv:20800_3_717
oh man, that's rough to hear from someone older than you. is she ok?	hit:10400_conv:20800_4_563
i am so envious of my sister, she has everything i just want to make her life hell	hit:10409_conv:20819_1_717
That doesn't sound very good, but jealousy is a hard thing to deal with	hit:10409_conv:20819_2_458
yeah but only i should get everything! no one else	hit:10409_conv:20819_3_717
Other people deserve to have things, too.	hit:10409_conv:20819_4_458
i am so embaressed at myself... i cant believe i fell down the stairs and my pants fell and my behind was exposed to the whole crowd 	hit:10410_conv:20821_1_717
"Oh no! When that happens you have to get up and yell, ""Safe!"""	hit:10410_conv:20821_2_409
indeed, but this time i was red and yelling in my head	hit:10410_conv:20821_3_717
Awww, well it happens to everyone sometimes. Just try to forget it. 	hit:10410_conv:20821_4_409
don't you think life is peaceful? are you content?	hit:10412_conv:20825_1_717
eh not really. what about you	hit:10412_conv:20825_2_563
i did, espcially today when i woke up, i realised how everything is meaningful and how i can't just waste my life chasing after money and stupid things like that, so i decided to work hard on becoming free	hit:10412_conv:20825_3_717
and what does that mean practically? what will you do differently?	hit:10412_conv:20825_4_563
i will work on the things i enjoy, which is knowledge and learning more and go for nature walks more often	hit:10412_conv:20825_5_717
i love walking in nature. hiking is a great way to exercise and to explore the outdoors	hit:10412_conv:20825_6_563
I've known my best friend since I was 4 years old.  He joined the Air Force after high school and moved out of state and I was really upset when he left.	hit:10413_conv:20827_1_403
Oh it's always sad when someone you care about leaves. Can you at least keep in contact with him?	hit:10413_conv:20827_2_409
Oh yeah, we still keep in contact over the Internet daily and visit each other every few years.  But I miss when we used to hang out every day.	hit:10413_conv:20827_3_403
I know. It is hard to say goodbye to people but he is doing a wonderful thing at least. 	hit:10413_conv:20827_4_409
the future is so uncertain and yet so certain i am so not ready for what's about to come it fills mee with anxiety and depression just thinking about it	hit:10414_conv:20829_1_717
Everything is going to be okay. Try to relax. 	hit:10414_conv:20829_2_409
i hope so	hit:10414_conv:20829_3_717
If there is something in particular, try to deal with it head on. 	hit:10414_conv:20829_4_409
I have been spending a year learning a new skill and after so much study and hard work it is finally paying off. I am feeling faithful again. 	hit:10434_conv:20869_1_725
that is great.. may i know what you have learnt	hit:10434_conv:20869_2_2
I have been learning to trade on the Forex markets.	hit:10434_conv:20869_3_725
it is challenging i guess.. best wishes that you developed skill over it	hit:10434_conv:20869_4_2
Thank you sir, have a great day!	hit:10434_conv:20869_5_725
great day to you too	hit:10434_conv:20869_6_2
i am so prepared the exam tomorrow!	hit:10441_conv:20882_1_717
How hard have you been studying? Exams are extreme amounts of mental crunch time!	hit:10441_conv:20882_2_381
yup but i have been studying since for a year 	hit:10441_conv:20882_3_717
You sound very confident! I wish I had your confidence when I was in school.	hit:10441_conv:20882_4_381
tomorrow i have interview and i have done my study so i am feeling confident	hit:10442_conv:20884_1_717
I bet you will do great! What job is the interview for?	hit:10442_conv:20884_2_211
art design	hit:10442_conv:20884_3_717
That's a great field. My daughter just got a degree in art but she hasn't been able to find a job yet. Good luck tomorrow!	hit:10442_conv:20884_4_211
thank you! i have a freelaning job at art already but i just want the qualifcation for more, maybe your daughter can do the same thing	hit:10442_conv:20884_5_717
I did so well in that biology exam haha, i anticipated those questions to come up i was so ready	hit:10445_conv:20890_1_717
Good for you. Being prepared is always better than the alternative.	hit:10445_conv:20890_2_548
yup! defiently, i am so amazing 	hit:10445_conv:20890_3_717
Don't get too cocky but enjoy your victory you deserve it.	hit:10445_conv:20890_4_548
i am so mad at myself, i woke up late again today and missed a very important deadline, even though i set 4 alarms	hit:10447_conv:20894_1_717
Oh no! You must feel really bad. Are you able to fix the problem?	hit:10447_conv:20894_2_211
no, i can't i just need to fix myself as  i am the problem	hit:10447_conv:20894_3_717
Please try not to be so hard on yourself! We all make mistakes.	hit:10447_conv:20894_4_211
I really hate going to the doctor. I was hesitant about going this time.	hit:10473_conv:20947_1_13
Why do you need to go to the doctor?	hit:10473_conv:20947_2_734
I had a painful cyst and I knew I would have to get a needle.	hit:10473_conv:20947_3_13
Oh that's terrible. Did they take care of it?	hit:10473_conv:20947_4_734
I was planning on going to grad school and I told a lot of people. I ended up not going, and I felt embarrassed every time someone asked me about how school was going.	hit:10480_conv:20961_1_573
That sounds very uncomfortable. Were you honest with them about your change of plans?	hit:10480_conv:20961_2_736
Yes. Without really giving details, I always kind of shrugged off their questions and told them that it didn't work out.	hit:10480_conv:20961_3_573
Right. 	hit:10480_conv:20961_4_736
I found a picture of my daughter and me from when I took her to a waterfall a long time ago. It brought tears to my eyes.	hit:10491_conv:20983_1_475
Oh I bet that was amazing! I have a memory of going to a waterfall with my parents when I was young and it's a nice thing to think back on. Does your daughter remember it?	hit:10491_conv:20983_2_435
Yes she does. Of course she doesn't see the sentimentality of it yet as I do. She is only 23. 	hit:10491_conv:20983_3_475
One day she'll look back and it will mean so much to her! Memories with parents are the best ones.	hit:10491_conv:20983_4_435
I have the worst fear of carnival rides, i always think they	hit:10493_conv:20987_1_614
I totally understand, I hate carnival rides too, they always feel so rickety. Do you have a particular one you fear the most?	hit:10493_conv:20987_2_35
(pressed enter too early). I love thrill rides, but i don't trust any carnival ride that gets rebuilt every time the fair opens up, too many horror stories. I mostly hate the ones that spin you a million different directions.	hit:10493_conv:20987_3_614
Agreed, a good theme park is nice because you know they have high safety standards, but those carnival ones scare the crap out of me.	hit:10493_conv:20987_4_35
My wife's cousin was sent to the hospital and was placed in a medically induced coma with something having to do with his lungs	hit:10494_conv:20988_1_475
Oh my goodness! That sounds awful! Was this recently?	hit:10494_conv:20988_2_727
Yes. They aren't sure what's wrong but his oxygen level is down to 40%	hit:10494_conv:20988_3_475
I'm so sorry to hear that. Hopefully he has a good team of doctors that figure out what is going on. Are y'all able to visit him?	hit:10494_conv:20988_4_727
I was on the highway during a strong thunderstorm, no visibility. I had a bad feeling someone bad was going to happen and no more than 10 minutes later two cars in front of me crash and one gets flipped over.	hit:10496_conv:20993_1_614
That's so scary!  You must have strong intuition	hit:10496_conv:20993_2_527
Yeah I honestly don't but the whole mood on that highway just felt right for that to happen. A lot of people weaving and having their hazards on for no reason.	hit:10496_conv:20993_3_614
I'm so glad you came out of it okay.  I hate driving in bad weather and reckless driving just makes it worse.	hit:10496_conv:20993_4_527
Walking to a restaurant the other day and I forgot to hold the door open for an old lady, felt so bad about it because she was right next to the door too.	hit:10498_conv:20997_1_614
It was nice of you to at least think of it. I'm sure she wasn't that upset.	hit:10498_conv:20997_2_435
I hope so, i usually hold it open for everybody but i was distracted and didn't see her.	hit:10498_conv:20997_3_614
It's totally understandable. Life can get really busy sometimes!	hit:10498_conv:20997_4_435
I bought a new phone recently and not long after i dropped it and shattered the screen, first time this happens and it was just terrible.	hit:10500_conv:21001_1_614
Oh, that's not good. Did you get a warranty for the phone?	hit:10500_conv:21001_2_540
No I usually don't since i've never dropped mines but I do get warranty now. It wasn't a cheap repair either.	hit:10500_conv:21001_3_614
I'm sorry to hear that. I hope that everything works out for you.	hit:10500_conv:21001_4_540
I was disgusted when my dog tried to attack another dog	hit:10503_conv:21006_1_259
Did the other dog provoke him? I wouldn't stress it too much, its just natural behavior for them, take him to training school.	hit:10503_conv:21006_2_614
Not really, but he knows better. I think I will get a trainer.	hit:10503_conv:21006_3_259
Oh then yeah, invest in a trainer. I love dogs a lot but an aggressive dog is very dangerous.	hit:10503_conv:21006_4_614
Saw an old cassette of my cousins fifteens and saw my mother before she passed away, felt nice seeing her on video again.	hit:10503_conv:21007_1_614
Oh I'm so sorry but I bet that was very special of you to find.	hit:10503_conv:21007_2_259
Yeah sadly we don't have many videos of her but the few we have we keep them safe and stored.	hit:10503_conv:21007_3_614
I would definitely make digital copies and upload to a cloud or a disk in case something happens.	hit:10503_conv:21007_4_259
I got the scores for my final exam. got a B and passed the class, it was a good day to celebrate.	hit:10504_conv:21008_1_614
That's awesome!  Congratulations!	hit:10504_conv:21008_2_458
Yeah, i pampered myself and went with some friends to a Japanese sushi place.	hit:10504_conv:21008_3_614
Nice choice!  Getting a B is definitely something to celebrate	hit:10504_conv:21008_4_458
Ordered a new pair of headphones online. They are a really high end pair so I'm very excited to finally get them.	hit:10505_conv:21011_1_614
That's exciting!  There's nothing like listening to your favorite music with great headphones	hit:10505_conv:21011_2_458
Yeah, it really is a day and night difference. Let's you appreciate the intricacies of a song much better.	hit:10505_conv:21011_3_614
I agree 100%.  Sounds like it's time to start downloading some new tunes to test out!	hit:10505_conv:21011_4_458
My wife is having a hard time after finding out we can no longer have children. I am doing my best to support her and care for her but it is very hard when nothing seems to work.	hit:10507_conv:21014_1_475
Oh thats heartbreaking, do you guys already have children?	hit:10507_conv:21014_2_614
I do but she doesn't. Which makes it harder I think. All I can do is be there for her and hope time helps her heal.	hit:10507_conv:21014_3_475
I really hope she gets better too, it must be terrible to know you cant have any kids. You're a good man for helping her cope.	hit:10507_conv:21014_4_614
Back in middle school i had a crush on a girl and one day in class she was talking to another guy. I was jealous for a while but it didn't matter anyways. I ended up getting her.	hit:10507_conv:21015_1_614
Young love, it's such a bittersweet quest.	hit:10507_conv:21015_2_475
It is, those were the funnest days. No responsibilities.	hit:10507_conv:21015_3_614
I know right? I wish I was young again sometimes.	hit:10507_conv:21015_4_475
I had a lot of feelings when I found pictures of my dog who has passed.	hit:10519_conv:21039_1_259
It's always difficult losing a pet.  I'm sure you had a flood of positive memories and sadness than they're gone	hit:10519_conv:21039_2_720
It was very bittersweet. She could not work her legs anymore due to age.	hit:10519_conv:21039_3_259
You just have to remember what a good life she had with you!	hit:10519_conv:21039_4_720
I moved to my current town one year ago and I really like it here. I'm happy and couldn't think of a better place to live.	hit:10523_conv:21047_1_573
Nice! Why do you like it more than other places you've lived?	hit:10523_conv:21047_2_641
It's my first time living in a small town. I love the fresh air. I have also met some great people.	hit:10523_conv:21047_3_573
That's good! I've always heard that people are closer friends to each other in a small town.	hit:10523_conv:21047_4_641
Either that, or people are just nosier and love getting into each other's business! Just kidding. I think the slower pace of life just makes people nicer.	hit:10523_conv:21047_5_573
I very much could count on my mom to always be there for me.	hit:10524_conv:21049_1_259
That's a blessing.  I know a lot of people didn't have a mom like that.	hit:10524_conv:21049_2_85
Me too. I am so thankful for her.	hit:10524_conv:21049_3_259
Is there anything she does specifically for her?	hit:10524_conv:21049_4_85
I was upset when I failed my math test	hit:10525_conv:21051_1_259
I'm sorry. I know how that feels. Did you study really hard?	hit:10525_conv:21051_2_536
I did, but the material was a hard subject.	hit:10525_conv:21051_3_259
Oh, okay. Maybe you should ask your teacher for some extra help or find a study buddy. i hope you do better next time.	hit:10525_conv:21051_4_536
I'm glad I can trust my husband to always be there for me.	hit:10526_conv:21052_1_259
That's sweet! I have a great husband too! How long have you been married?	hit:10526_conv:21052_2_727
Just under two years. Still feel like a newlywed@	hit:10526_conv:21052_3_259
That's great! We've been married for almost 10 years and I still feel like a newlywed. It's great when you marry your best friend.	hit:10526_conv:21052_4_727
Hi friend! Wow, I was so scared of this taxi driver when I was vacationing in Mexico. He looked rather suspicious.	hit:10529_conv:21058_1_725
Oh gosh! That sounds frightening! Did you get out the taxi as soon as you could?	hit:10529_conv:21058_2_390
No, I just trusted him. But I wrote all his details in my phone just in case. 	hit:10529_conv:21058_3_725
Oh, well that was a smart thing to do. I would've bailed. lol	hit:10529_conv:21058_4_390
Yeah but the car was on the highway and I could not get out. Thankfully everything was alright. Never again though!	hit:10529_conv:21058_5_725
I was storing all of my old photos on my new external hard drive yesterday. It made me wish I could go back and time and see some relatives again.	hit:10531_conv:21062_1_549
I usually love the trips down memory lane, but the sad side of it are the ones who are no longer around. I'm sorry.	hit:10531_conv:21062_2_302
It's bittersweet! Nice to see their faces again, but sad to miss them.	hit:10531_conv:21062_3_549
I'm right there with you. It makes you shed a tear sometimes too.	hit:10531_conv:21062_4_302
I lied to my friend about something and told her something was okay when it really wasn't	hit:10534_conv:21068_1_13
Oh. I know lying is sometimes beneficial in some situations. Hopefully you did this to protect someone's feelings	hit:10534_conv:21068_2_363
I just felt really bad and guilty that I did it.	hit:10534_conv:21068_3_13
Yeah, I think that means you have a conscience, which is a good thing. If you didn't feel bad, I'd worry about you!	hit:10534_conv:21068_4_363
Sometimes a fly gets in my apartment and I hold my cat over my head and we chase it. She hasn't scratched or bitten me once while we do this!	hit:10537_conv:21074_1_549
That would make a funny video! We have a super friendly, playful cat too.	hit:10537_conv:21074_2_727
I love cats. They're so funny and such good company!	hit:10537_conv:21074_3_549
Yes, they are. He is my daughter's best friend. She can do whatever she wants and he is unphased.	hit:10537_conv:21074_4_727
I babysat my nephew overnight last weekend. He was scared so I let him sleep in bed with me, even though he kicks a lot.	hit:10540_conv:21081_1_549
That was thoughtful, sometimes i think kids fake being scared just to not be alone. hope you didn't get kicked too much!	hit:10540_conv:21081_2_290
Haha I didn't sleep a wink. He's only 8. He pretends to be all cool, but he's still very much a little kid.	hit:10540_conv:21081_3_549
Kids are interesting creatures that's for sure. I'm sure you got some cool uncle points.	hit:10540_conv:21081_4_290
I'm an auntie :p	hit:10540_conv:21081_5_549
My mistake :)	hit:10540_conv:21081_6_290
my pet dog is always there for me. No matter what, I can count on her.	hit:10541_conv:21082_1_675
I feel the same way about my dog.  They're the greatest!	hit:10541_conv:21082_2_720
yes they are they are always happy to see you and they will always there for you	hit:10541_conv:21082_3_675
I don't know what I would do without my dog.  I'm glad you have one that's always there for you!	hit:10541_conv:21082_4_720
I had a great breakfast this morning. It was delicious and I felt very happy and relaxed.	hit:10545_conv:21090_1_549
Nice! What did you have? I am planning to serve breakfast for dinner tonight.	hit:10545_conv:21090_2_684
Eggs, bacon, strawberries, tomatoes, and coffee. So yummy!	hit:10545_conv:21090_3_549
Mmmm. that sounds really good! I'm thinking biscuit and sausage gravy, hash brown and eggs...	hit:10545_conv:21090_4_684
I called someone by the wrong name earlier today. I didn't really know them and hadn't seen them in ages.	hit:10549_conv:21099_1_549
I hate when that happens. I bet you meant well but you're left looking like a crazy person! I hope they understood.	hit:10549_conv:21099_2_302
They were ok with it, but I hope I didn't hurt their feelings.	hit:10549_conv:21099_3_549
I think they will get over it. Most people understood that not everyone is going to remember every little thing.	hit:10549_conv:21099_4_302
The other day we were in the front yard, and you won't believe what happened!	hit:10551_conv:21102_1_305
What happened? The yard always has mysteries!	hit:10551_conv:21102_2_641
My 4 year-old just dropped his pants and started peeing in the grass!	hit:10551_conv:21102_3_305
Shocking! Has your kid done that before?	hit:10551_conv:21102_4_641
No!  All of the neighbors were out there, too!	hit:10551_conv:21102_5_305
I got into an argument with my husband and I realized later that he was right but I never apologized. :(	hit:10552_conv:21105_1_725
Maybe you should find him and apologize right now.	hit:10552_conv:21105_2_741
Yes maybe I should but my ego gets in the way.	hit:10552_conv:21105_3_725
You could just cook him a nice dinner or plan a special date instead. 	hit:10552_conv:21105_4_741
That is a cool idea! Thanks for the great advice! I will do that right now. :)	hit:10552_conv:21105_5_725
Your welcome! Glad I could help!	hit:10552_conv:21105_6_741
I'm unemployed and struggling right now. I feel really bad when people talk to me about their new stuff, even though they're not trying to be mean	hit:10554_conv:21109_1_549
I can understand the feeling, I went through a couple of spells like that in the past. I'm sure they mean well but you're at a point where you're hurting to get back out there.	hit:10554_conv:21109_2_302
yeah! I just want to be able to support myself and not go to the food bank or rely on friends and family	hit:10554_conv:21109_3_549
You'll return to self-sufficiency soon, you just can't let yourself fall into a pit of self doubt. Stay confident.	hit:10554_conv:21109_4_302
I am so sad. My 3 dogs attacked my baby goat and she died last night from the injuries. Crying....	hit:10555_conv:21110_1_725
Aww, that's so sad. I'm an animal lover so I understand the pain.	hit:10555_conv:21110_2_135
It hurts really bad and I don't know what to do. I think I should give some dogs away to a family with no small animals.	hit:10555_conv:21110_3_725
That's a really tough decision either way. I wish you the best with it and hope everything improves	hit:10555_conv:21110_4_135
Thanks for listening my friend.	hit:10555_conv:21110_5_725
One of my love birds had a baby but she is a terrible mother. So I am now taking care of the baby and feeding her everyday. She is so cute!	hit:10559_conv:21119_1_725
Ah what a responsibly to take on! You are a great example, is it quite tough?	hit:10559_conv:21119_2_657
No. The baby bird just sleeps and eats do it is really easy. 	hit:10559_conv:21119_3_725
Alot easier than a kitten or a puppy then?	hit:10559_conv:21119_4_657
Yes! I think so, haha!	hit:10559_conv:21119_5_725
Keep up the good work!	hit:10559_conv:21119_6_657
I feel very happy that I moved out in the country. I thought I was a city person but I guess not.	hit:10561_conv:21123_1_725
I bet you can see the stars and hear all sorts of wildlife at night.	hit:10561_conv:21123_2_302
Oh yes. It was hard to get used to at first but now I barely notice it.	hit:10561_conv:21123_3_725
All that outside noise can become so soothing if you left it.	hit:10561_conv:21123_4_302
Yes I think so. I especially enjoy this night owl that hoo's everynight.	hit:10561_conv:21123_5_725
Living out in the woods can really make you put things in perspective too.	hit:10561_conv:21123_6_302
Sure does. Your welcome to visit any time my friend.	hit:10561_conv:21123_7_725
Thanks that is quite the offer. How kind.	hit:10561_conv:21123_8_302
I really wanted to go on this fruitarian trip to Bali butI could not get off work. My friends went without me	hit:10565_conv:21131_1_725
Did you wait until the last minute to ask for time off?	hit:10565_conv:21131_2_46
No. My boss is not a very nice person. I think I should find a new job.	hit:10565_conv:21131_3_725
Yeah you might want to look into it then	hit:10565_conv:21131_4_46
Thanks for your advice my friend!	hit:10565_conv:21131_5_725
My dog is feeling sick and I don't know what is wrong.	hit:10568_conv:21137_1_725
Oh no! Have you tried taking your dog to the vet?	hit:10568_conv:21137_2_742
I hate the vets. They charge so much money. Maybe I can google seomthing.	hit:10568_conv:21137_3_725
Yes, google has a lot of great information for pet care.	hit:10568_conv:21137_4_742
Thanks fo your advice my friend!	hit:10568_conv:21137_5_725
I am learning how to do day trading and did my first trade and I won	hit:10570_conv:21141_1_725
Well that sounds like a high stress occupation!	hit:10570_conv:21141_2_338
You think? It sure is exciting, at least when I win.	hit:10570_conv:21141_3_725
I'm glad you like it. I think it would be hard to get it right every time the way the market is sometimes.	hit:10570_conv:21141_4_338
Your right. Let's see how I do next week.	hit:10570_conv:21141_5_725
I wish you the very best with it all!	hit:10570_conv:21141_6_338
Thanks my friend!	hit:10570_conv:21141_7_725
You're welcome. Be careful not to chase stocks too hard, they don't always turn the way you might hope!	hit:10570_conv:21141_8_338
My dogs keep attacking my poor ducks. I don't know what to do	hit:10572_conv:21144_1_725
I don't know what you can do. A duck is just a toy that taste good to a dog.	hit:10572_conv:21144_2_231
I scream at the dogs and it seems to be working but I never know what can happen in the future.	hit:10572_conv:21144_3_725
Dogs gonna do dog stuff. That's just how they do.	hit:10572_conv:21144_4_231
Yep. Talk to later my friend.	hit:10572_conv:21144_5_725
I packing to go on an international trip. I hope I don't forget anything.	hit:10573_conv:21146_1_725
That would be bad you should double check before you leave	hit:10573_conv:21146_2_46
I feel I can't fit anything else in my suitcase so I think I have it all. But I will double check like you said. :)	hit:10573_conv:21146_3_725
Yeah it is better to be safe than sorry	hit:10573_conv:21146_4_46
You are so right! See you when I get back my friend!	hit:10573_conv:21146_5_725
I was ashamed when my dog started barking loudly when I was away.	hit:10575_conv:21151_1_259
Why were you ashamed? Did she disturb the neighbors or something?	hit:10575_conv:21151_2_536
Yes, my neighbors were very angry.	hit:10575_conv:21151_3_259
I'm sorry that happened. You might need to get her obedience training,	hit:10575_conv:21151_4_536
I am exciting that my father said he would come and visit me soon. He travels so much and it is hard to get his time	hit:10578_conv:21156_1_725
Thats awesome! do yall have any plans? 	hit:10578_conv:21156_2_554
We are just going to hang out on the farm and hang out with the cows, ha ha	hit:10578_conv:21156_3_725
lol maybe yall could find something to bond over	hit:10578_conv:21156_4_554
We have a great relationship so just each others company is good enough.	hit:10578_conv:21156_5_725
Oh how I miss my days when I was in my twenties. Those were such fun times. To be young and free!	hit:10580_conv:21161_1_725
Yeah we dont thinnk about how special it was until it is gone	hit:10580_conv:21161_2_46
It is so true. We take it for granted. I wish I knew then what I know now.	hit:10580_conv:21161_3_725
Yeah we all do but we can only go forward	hit:10580_conv:21161_4_46
Very true my friend.	hit:10580_conv:21161_5_725
My cockatiel is feeling sick. I think she might die soon. I wish there was something I could do.	hit:10582_conv:21165_1_725
Have you taken her to the vet?	hit:10582_conv:21165_2_46
No. There are no vets where I live. I gave her some medicine though but nothing seems to be working.	hit:10582_conv:21165_3_725
You might want to look up what is going on online	hit:10582_conv:21165_4_46
That is a good idea. I will take a look. Thanks my friend.	hit:10582_conv:21165_5_725
yesterday i notice people were laughing behind me, when I finally got to my desk, a coworker pointed out that a postage stamp was stuck to the back of my head	hit:10594_conv:21189_1_675
That sucks. Next time they should tell you instead of laughing!	hit:10594_conv:21189_2_741
well looking back its funny, but man, yesterday i wished i could hide, plus I think my boss seen it too	hit:10594_conv:21189_3_675
I'm sure it's not so bad. At least you can laugh about it now!	hit:10594_conv:21189_4_741
i am up for a promotion at my job. I positive I will get it.	hit:10599_conv:21198_1_675
That is great! you should celebrate and enjoy this momment	hit:10599_conv:21198_2_46
 I already have plans to go out to a nice restaurant and celebrate with my family	hit:10599_conv:21198_3_675
that is good! I hope you enjoy yourself	hit:10599_conv:21198_4_46
i have a big presentation at my job at the end of this week. I am ready for it	hit:10605_conv:21210_1_675
Awesome! What's it about?	hit:10605_conv:21210_2_641
its about how some customers are not choosing our slow moving products. i have been working on it for weeks. i got it nailed down	hit:10605_conv:21210_3_675
Congrats! I hope it goes well. Are you presenting to a board of directors?	hit:10605_conv:21210_4_641
a neighbor  just bought a brand new Lexus,  why can't I get one	hit:10608_conv:21216_1_675
Maybe you can save more and be able to get one.	hit:10608_conv:21216_2_650
its not just that, this neighbor is always buying expensive things and likes to show them off	hit:10608_conv:21216_3_675
Man that gets to me when someone does that , like they are better than everyone else.	hit:10608_conv:21216_4_650
i really miss the holidays when our family got together	hit:10611_conv:21223_1_675
The holidays are a great time for that sort of thing. What did your family do together?	hit:10611_conv:21223_2_609
just the normal stuff,  but the kids are all grown up.Holidays are never the same without having kids around to enjoy it	hit:10611_conv:21223_3_675
I understand what you mean.  I hope you and your family are all able to get together and enjoy each other's company soon.	hit:10611_conv:21223_4_609
There is a job promotion coming up. I really do wish i can get it	hit:10613_conv:21226_1_675
I hope you can have you applied or did you interview already?	hit:10613_conv:21226_2_248
i have interview for it and thinking i might get it but you never know	hit:10613_conv:21226_3_675
well have you practiced interviewing? With that you can feel so much better!	hit:10613_conv:21226_4_248
i thought I was going to get a promotion. I found out I did not get it	hit:10620_conv:21241_1_675
I'm sorry to hear that. Hopefully something better is coming along for you soon.	hit:10620_conv:21241_2_254
thank you, i was really depending on this promotion	hit:10620_conv:21241_3_675
Keep working hard and I think your efforts will eventually be noticed.	hit:10620_conv:21241_4_254
my pet dog pooped all over my rug last week. She never did that before	hit:10623_conv:21247_1_675
Ah that always sucks, did she need to go out or is she sick or something?	hit:10623_conv:21247_2_558
i don't know, she never did that before, i don't know if the crap or her behavior got to me more	hit:10623_conv:21247_3_675
Well it isn't as if she did it on purpose dogs always have a reason.	hit:10623_conv:21247_4_558
ugh, I have a cavity and I do not want to go to the dentist	hit:10627_conv:21255_1_675
Oh no, is it painful and disrupting you in anyway? 	hit:10627_conv:21255_2_631
its painful but the thought of it being pulled kind of freaks me out plus the cost of it.	hit:10627_conv:21255_3_675
Yeah, I know what you mean it does sound very scary, but they do numb your face and usually they do not pull it out, they fill in the cavity! 	hit:10627_conv:21255_4_631
We didn't really have anything planned this last weekend, so were thinking we'd be productive.	hit:10633_conv:21267_1_305
What did you do?	hit:10633_conv:21267_2_616
Well, plans got changed.  It rained like crazy, so we couldn't work outside.	hit:10633_conv:21267_3_305
It has been raining a lot here too. Definitely ruins a weekend planned outside of the house.	hit:10633_conv:21267_4_616
It was okay, though. We got to spend some time hanging out and had a low-key weekend.	hit:10633_conv:21267_5_305
That's good, sometimes it's good to just be lazy inside the house.	hit:10633_conv:21267_6_616
I still haven't been able to finish my dad's Father's Day gift.	hit:10635_conv:21270_1_305
so are you making him a gift?	hit:10635_conv:21270_2_675
Yeah, we're rebuilding a porch swing for him.  But I've had to hunt down some tooling.	hit:10635_conv:21270_3_305
don't worry about it you will get it done and he will be proud of it	hit:10635_conv:21270_4_675
Thanks, I hope so!	hit:10635_conv:21270_5_305
i have to fly out of town next week. I do not know if I can, I have cold sweats thinking about it	hit:10635_conv:21271_1_675
Do you have a general fear of flying, or is there something about this trip?	hit:10635_conv:21271_2_305
it s the fear of flying, just the thought of it frightens me	hit:10635_conv:21271_3_675
Have you always had a fear of flying?  I haven't ever really feared it, but I don't like it.	hit:10635_conv:21271_4_305
Man, I really thought today could be a crazy day.	hit:10637_conv:21274_1_305
Was it another boring day today? 	hit:10637_conv:21274_2_631
Well, it sort of turned out that way.  There was a big event at work today, and I wasn't sure how it would go.	hit:10637_conv:21274_3_305
Ohh okay I see, yeah I always get excited when new things happen at work too. 	hit:10637_conv:21274_4_631
over the weekend i  fell off my diet by eating a big bag of peanut M&Ms	hit:10638_conv:21276_1_675
I know the feeling. Hang in there! tomorrow is always a new day 	hit:10638_conv:21276_2_554
you know the worst part of it, is that i hid it from my partner who is proud of me dieting, i feel bad for it	hit:10638_conv:21276_3_675
Did you hide the wrappers?	hit:10638_conv:21276_4_554
I always buy the same brand of yogurt and don't even bother trying other kinds. It's just so delicious and such a good price that I'm a loyal customer for life	hit:10639_conv:21278_1_549
There's very few brands I feel that strongly about. What kind of yogurt is it, I might want to try it?	hit:10639_conv:21278_2_138
Astro balkan plain! It's not as pastey as greek yogurt, or runny like other kinds	hit:10639_conv:21278_3_549
I don't think I have ever seen that kind in the store, I'll have to look for it next time I go. I don't care much for the runny yogurt, but I like greek yogurt so long as it's whole fat and sweet.	hit:10639_conv:21278_4_138
I lost my job because I got diagnosed with a chronic disease. It's a real double whammy - loss of income and an incurable disease. I'm still angry and upset, three months later.	hit:10641_conv:21283_1_549
That is horrible. Americas government wont be of help....hopefully you have family?	hit:10641_conv:21283_2_748
No I'm all by myself	hit:10641_conv:21283_3_549
No cat or dog?	hit:10641_conv:21283_4_748
Have you ever had a strong attachment and love for an animal?   I have had several.	hit:10644_conv:21289_1_587
Yes I love animals and have 3 dogs right now.	hit:10644_conv:21289_2_650
Well then you will understand the love I had for my pitbull named Lily.   We had a special bond and when she died it broke my heart.  Never leave a candle burning and leave the house.   OUr house burned and she died of smoke inhalation.  I will never forget her!	hit:10644_conv:21289_3_587
I'm sorry that happened to you and I will take your advice.	hit:10644_conv:21289_4_650
Once during a snowstorm I had to go to the airport. My taxi driver decided that driving on the highway in the middle of nowhere late at night was the perfect time to tell me all about how he would kill a man	hit:10650_conv:21301_1_549
That sounds super scary, could he tell that your were scared or nervous? How did you escape that situation?	hit:10650_conv:21301_2_138
I shrank into myself and prayed for the car to go faster and not crash	hit:10650_conv:21301_3_549
Oh wow, it's fortunate that you managed to get out of that situation alive. I'm glad you made it out of that awful situation. 	hit:10650_conv:21301_4_138
One time there was a homeless guy running towards my car	hit:10652_conv:21304_1_547
That sounds a little scary. Why was he running towards your car?	hit:10652_conv:21304_2_630
He wanted money!	hit:10652_conv:21304_3_547
Did you give him any?	hit:10652_conv:21304_4_630
NO!	hit:10652_conv:21304_5_547
I'm really stressed today so I bought a box of Pirate peanut butter cookies and ate an entire sleeve of them. I feel pretty bad because I wrecked my dieting for at least two days	hit:10653_conv:21306_1_549
Aww, I am sorry, but I must say Pirate peanut butte cookies do sound good, did they help you feel any better?	hit:10653_conv:21306_2_674
In the short term, yes! They're oatmeal and peanut butter	hit:10653_conv:21306_3_549
Ugh, that sounds wonderful, I would do the same if I were stressed I think	hit:10653_conv:21306_4_674
One time I saw a person juggle chainsaws	hit:10657_conv:21314_1_547
That's amazing. Were you impressed?	hit:10657_conv:21314_2_630
Yes, he did it perfectly and did not hurt himself	hit:10657_conv:21314_3_547
That must take a lot of practice. I can't even juggle safe objects so I'd likely lose an arm if I tried to juggle chainsaws lol	hit:10657_conv:21314_4_630
I'm very ready for school to start!	hit:10660_conv:21320_1_259
Me, too!  I work at the registration department at a college and we're very busy until school starts.	hit:10660_conv:21320_2_85
There's just something so nostalgic about going to school. Reminds me of my childhood.	hit:10660_conv:21320_3_259
I think it's the feeling of the beginning of something new.	hit:10660_conv:21320_4_85
One time my mom made me lunch when I was too busy working!	hit:10661_conv:21322_1_547
Wow that is so sweet of her. She must really love you! 	hit:10661_conv:21322_2_631
I hope so! She always helps me and one day I will return the favor!	hit:10661_conv:21322_3_547
Wow that is fantastic, she is so lucky to have you around because you are such a sweet and caring person. :) 	hit:10661_conv:21322_4_631
My friend got a new job and I wish I had it too.	hit:10663_conv:21327_1_259
Good for you friend! I'm sure you'll find something soon. What field of work do you want to be in?	hit:10663_conv:21327_2_630
I work in video production. Super fun job, but I'm tired of the freelance life.	hit:10663_conv:21327_3_259
That does sound like a really fun job. I also work freelance and would also like something more stable. 	hit:10663_conv:21327_4_630
One time my family went out to vacation and I was home alone with no friends	hit:10664_conv:21329_1_547
Oh no, they went on vacation without you?? 	hit:10664_conv:21329_2_631
Yes, I had to work and could not get time off!	hit:10664_conv:21329_3_547
Oh no that sucks, I am sorry that you had to stay home alone. What did you do to entertain yourself? 	hit:10664_conv:21329_4_631
My pet cat died recently	hit:10669_conv:21338_1_547
Oh no, I am so sorry to hear that. How are you holding up? 	hit:10669_conv:21338_2_631
I am doing okay, my cat was old and is probably in a better place now :'(	hit:10669_conv:21338_3_547
Yes, I am sure that your cat is in a better place. If you ever want to talk to someone about it I am always here to listen. :) 	hit:10669_conv:21338_4_631
I am ready for my law exam	hit:10671_conv:21343_1_259
The big one? The bar? That's a whole lot of schooling and effort culminating in to one test! I imagine you're very excited, but anxious too.	hit:10671_conv:21343_2_666
Luckily not the bar yet! Just the end of summer class.	hit:10671_conv:21343_3_259
Ahh. Still, another stone set on the road to payoff. I wish you the best!	hit:10671_conv:21343_4_666
I knew I was ready for my college exam.	hit:10672_conv:21344_1_259
You study hard?	hit:10672_conv:21344_2_616
I did. Failed my last so I knew I had to make it right.	hit:10672_conv:21344_3_259
Oh no, I bet you aced this one then.	hit:10672_conv:21344_4_616
My brother keeps not washing the dishes!	hit:10673_conv:21346_1_547
Oh no, have you talked to him about it? 	hit:10673_conv:21346_2_631
Yes! He is such a manchild! He does not care about cleanliness!	hit:10673_conv:21346_3_547
Aww man, that sucks, I am guessing that you end up having to do all the dirty work because he has been slacking off. 	hit:10673_conv:21346_4_631
I was so mad when my dog got my dinner off the table.	hit:10674_conv:21348_1_259
Oh I would be pissed. Hopefully you had more so you could fix another plate.	hit:10674_conv:21348_2_616
I did, but he knows better.	hit:10674_conv:21348_3_259
Guessing he didn't get anymore food for dinner lol.	hit:10674_conv:21348_4_616
I visited my college campus today and memories came flooding back. I miss it.	hit:10677_conv:21354_1_259
I'd imagine so. What a great time of our lives college can be. The world just seems right, being surrounded by your peers, all sharing similar goals. 	hit:10677_conv:21354_2_666
It was so great. We all just wanted to learn.	hit:10677_conv:21354_3_259
Mmhm. I wish I studied more, paid more attention, and joined more clubs. But I guess that's the thing, you're already as busy as it gets, and unfortunately you can't experience it all.	hit:10677_conv:21354_4_666
I think I will pass my college test tomorrow.	hit:10678_conv:21356_1_259
 That is great, confidence is always a key in success! I believe that you will pass as well! 	hit:10678_conv:21356_2_631
Thank you. I'm ready for it to be over with.	hit:10678_conv:21356_3_259
Yeah I bet! You will do great, I have high hopes in you! :) 	hit:10678_conv:21356_4_631
I was a bit upset when my parents could not visit me this weekend.	hit:10680_conv:21361_1_259
Aw, that stinks. Why couldn't they come?	hit:10680_conv:21361_2_670
My dad had to work last minute. I got everything ready for them. Oh well.	hit:10680_conv:21361_3_259
That sounds really disappointing. Hopefully, you'll be able to see them soon! I'm sure they were excited too.	hit:10680_conv:21361_4_670
I was grossed out when I saw someone vomiting at a bar.	hit:10681_conv:21363_1_259
Oh man, I bet you did. I would have had a gag reflex if I saw some one puking at the bar. 	hit:10681_conv:21363_2_631
They couldn't even make it to the bathroom. Ugh.	hit:10681_conv:21363_3_259
Wow they must have had 1 too many drinks if they could not even get to the bathroom. I am sorry you had to see such a disgusting sight 	hit:10681_conv:21363_4_631
I'm very scared of the afterlife	hit:10684_conv:21368_1_259
Me too, it's so hard not knowing what to expect.	hit:10684_conv:21368_2_616
And we do not even know if we have an afterlife.	hit:10684_conv:21368_3_259
Right, no one truly knows until they get there, so scary.	hit:10684_conv:21368_4_616
I was very happy just reading a book by the pool today	hit:10685_conv:21371_1_259
What was the book about?	hit:10685_conv:21371_2_750
It was about the golden state killer. Very errie.	hit:10685_conv:21371_3_259

Oh, I understand. I also remember mine. Do you remember something else about that day?	hit:10686_conv:21372_2_495
I could not find my classes. It was almost comical.	hit:10686_conv:21372_3_259
I imagine it was a big college. what did happen at the end?	hit:10686_conv:21372_4_495
One time I won a stuffed animal from the claw machine!	hit:10687_conv:21374_1_547
Me too! I love that game!	hit:10687_conv:21374_2_259
Yup, I did it in my first try too!	hit:10687_conv:21374_3_547

I was so happy when my mom came to visit me	hit:10687_conv:21375_1_259

Any of them. I hate all their creepy legs.	hit:10688_conv:21376_3_259
Thats fair I guess, weird fish freak me out more then spiders through	hit:10688_conv:21376_4_328

She is 10 years younger than I am, and quite spoiled.  She always has the  nicest things.	hit:10690_conv:21381_3_587
Aww man that sucks, One day your hard work will pay off, so don't let it get to you too much. I am sure she is not intentially doing that	hit:10690_conv:21381_4_631
One time I saw a giant cockroach under my desk!	hit:10691_conv:21382_1_547

He did! I didn't know he could do that.	hit:10692_conv:21384_3_259
What prompted his back flip?	hit:10692_conv:21384_4_752
I forgot to invite my friend to dinner with our other friends.	hit:10693_conv:21386_1_259
It happens sometimes.  It only becomes a problem if you forget often.	hit:10693_conv:21386_2_85
Luckily I have not done it too many times.	hit:10693_conv:21386_3_259
I hope they were pretty understanding.	hit:10693_conv:21386_4_85
One time I wanted to eat at Burger King, but then I remembered that I was loyal to Mcdonalds	hit:10694_conv:21388_1_547
I hate burger king! McD's all the way	hit:10694_conv:21388_2_259
Your dam right! Even if the food is small, it tastes so good!	hit:10694_conv:21388_3_547

I was upset when I did not do well on a test.	hit:10694_conv:21389_1_259
That is unfortunate, did you fail the test?	hit:10694_conv:21389_2_547
Not exactly, but close enough. I will study better next time.	hit:10694_conv:21389_3_259

I did a few days later. They seemed sorry.	hit:10695_conv:21390_3_259
You should stop being their friend!	hit:10695_conv:21390_4_547
One time my friend said that I could tell him anything and she would snitch	hit:10695_conv:21391_1_547
Oh, snitches are no fun.	hit:10695_conv:21391_2_259
Yes, snitches get stiches	hit:10695_conv:21391_3_547
I would just keep to myself.	hit:10695_conv:21391_4_259
I remember years ago when I was a teenager.  I didnt treat her as well as I should have.	hit:10697_conv:21394_1_587
Who?	hit:10697_conv:21394_2_259
Oh so sorry, I meant to say I didnt treat my mother as well as I should have.  I often treated her with disrespect and disobedience.	hit:10697_conv:21394_3_587
Well I think as long as you say sorry, she can forgive.	hit:10697_conv:21394_4_259
My dog kept barking and waking me up	hit:10697_conv:21395_1_259
I know how annoying that can be.  I love dogs but they certainly get do annoying things at times.	hit:10697_conv:21395_2_587
I still do not know why he was barking.	hit:10697_conv:21395_3_259
Maybe there was something outside or maybe he just wanted attention.   Dogs behavior can be hard to figure out sometimes.   Good Luck!	hit:10697_conv:21395_4_587
One time I pooped my pants when I was trying to fart	hit:10698_conv:21396_1_547

Yeah, that was a surprising result.	hit:10701_conv:21402_2_630
I still do not know what to make of it	hit:10701_conv:21402_3_259
Does it make you feel like you're living in an alternate reality?	hit:10701_conv:21402_4_630
I did not like being alone at home at night.	hit:10702_conv:21405_1_259

My family left for the weekend and I'm so bored.	hit:10703_conv:21406_1_259
You can watch some movies	hit:10703_conv:21406_2_750
What should I watch?	hit:10703_conv:21406_3_259
It depends on your preference. I watch korean dramas.	hit:10703_conv:21406_4_750
I have realized that I have it good in life	hit:10704_conv:21408_1_547

It is a terrible disease where your ankles and calves are fused together	hit:10707_conv:21415_3_547
??? is it a cancer of some sort??	hit:10707_conv:21415_4_563
I love to volunteer for others	hit:10708_conv:21416_1_259
That is excellent! I wish I had the courage to do so, too. 	hit:10708_conv:21416_2_754
You should try! It is fun!	hit:10708_conv:21416_3_259

I was nervous for my first day of college.	hit:10709_conv:21418_1_259
oh yeah? was it because you didn't know if you could do the work, or because of all the hot college girls	hit:10709_conv:21418_2_563
Just nervous for new beginnings.	hit:10709_conv:21418_3_259

You should! They need a lot of attention though!	hit:10710_conv:21421_3_547
Yes, they do. And lots of care.	hit:10710_conv:21421_4_750
I was nervous for my first day of college	hit:10711_conv:21423_1_259
What about it made you feel nervous?	hit:10711_conv:21423_2_630
just nervous for a new start in life	hit:10711_conv:21423_3_259

I agree, they are the best. 	hit:10713_conv:21427_4_755
I realized I am happy with life	hit:10714_conv:21428_1_547

Yes, I am starting to appreciate lots of small things in life!	hit:10714_conv:21428_3_547
Small things like what?	hit:10714_conv:21428_4_750
One time my mom gave my brother a Happy Meal, and I got nothing!	hit:10719_conv:21439_1_547
Wow thats completely unfair!	hit:10719_conv:21439_2_757

Wow, lucky you. I play those once in a year only	hit:10721_conv:21442_2_495
I can understand that, as I usually dont have the money to play to very often.  I couldnt wait to go cash it in.  	hit:10721_conv:21442_3_587
I do not play too much because if I do not win, I feel it is a waste of money.	hit:10721_conv:21442_4_495
I studied all night for a test. I think I can pass it, even though I was sleepy	hit:10722_conv:21445_1_547

Organic chemistry!	hit:10722_conv:21445_3_547
I hate chemistry because I think we should leave all that stuff to nature and just live our lives as the animals we are	hit:10722_conv:21445_4_563
I agree!	hit:10722_conv:21445_5_547
do you have a good teacher?	hit:10722_conv:21445_6_563
One time they gave me ketchup packets instead of spicy sauce. I was so mad!	hit:10723_conv:21447_1_547
Wow that is annoying. Did you get a spicy packet after?	hit:10723_conv:21447_2_182
No, I was pouting all day! 	hit:10723_conv:21447_3_547

No, but I like losing myself in my thoughts when drinking coffee!	hit:10724_conv:21449_3_547
I see, that is such a nice way to remember your past,.	hit:10724_conv:21449_4_182

I failed unfortunately, but I liked my optimism!	hit:10727_conv:21455_3_547

oh you must love getting cancer results!	hit:10731_conv:21463_2_563
Well it does get my heart beating fast!	hit:10731_conv:21463_3_547
that's why I do it, for a great cardio workout. so what were the results?	hit:10731_conv:21463_4_563
One time my house started flooding from a hurricane!	hit:10732_conv:21465_1_547

One time I skipped my friend's birthday party to watch TV	hit:10733_conv:21467_1_547
I hope something good was on	hit:10733_conv:21467_2_563
There was! But I felt so bad afterwards. I'm a monster	hit:10733_conv:21467_3_547

One time my mom bought an ice cream from Mcdonalds!	hit:10735_conv:21471_1_547
Really? what kind of icecream?	hit:10735_conv:21471_2_752
A plain vanilla one. It is rare since their machine is always broken!	hit:10735_conv:21471_3_547
That is a good one! it is not always broken though. Sometimes they are out of ice cream mix because the workers eat it all	hit:10735_conv:21471_4_752
One time when I was little, I was scared of going to sleep without a night light	hit:10737_conv:21474_1_547
That is a rational fear when you are little. How did you overcome it?	hit:10737_conv:21474_2_752
I became depressed and I felt nothing	hit:10737_conv:21474_3_547
Oh that is a bad place to go	hit:10737_conv:21474_4_752
One time there was this really cool person I was talking to on a chatroom	hit:10739_conv:21478_1_547

One time a person offered to drive me home when it was raining outside	hit:10741_conv:21483_1_547
He must be a good person bit if he's a stranger, is it safe?	hit:10741_conv:21483_2_520
It was super creepy, I did not take the offer !	hit:10741_conv:21483_3_547
That is good safety first	hit:10741_conv:21483_4_520
 My cat passed away because of old age	hit:10744_conv:21488_1_547

I called him Pizza Guy	hit:10744_conv:21488_3_547
That is cute! is there a meaning behind that name?	hit:10744_conv:21488_4_752
In all my relationships,i always choose to honest as much as i can. I never want to my partner to stop believing in me	hit:10747_conv:21494_1_6
That is good! Never accept anything less!	hit:10747_conv:21494_2_547
Exactly,you receive what you get. Nothing less.	hit:10747_conv:21494_3_6
I'm rooting for you! Get your dream person!	hit:10747_conv:21494_4_547
One time I kept waiting for this person to respond to my texts. He never did	hit:10747_conv:21495_1_547
I can imagine how it feel,more so if its someone who never leaves his/her phone down.	hit:10747_conv:21495_2_6
Yes, I do not like being ignored >:(	hit:10747_conv:21495_3_547
The writing is very clear on the wall. You have been ignored.	hit:10747_conv:21495_4_6
i'm starting university in two days and i'm kind of stressed because i'll be studying with new teachers and i have no idea what they will be like	hit:10750_conv:21501_1_717
Wow, that sounds intense! I hope you'll find out there was nothing to be stressed about after all!	hit:10750_conv:21501_2_77
yeah but i hate having mean teachers , the ones that are not open for different ways of explaining things. so i really hope i won't have anyone like that	hit:10750_conv:21501_3_717

sometimes i get scared because i fear not being able to achieve my goals in life	hit:10752_conv:21505_1_717
I feel you. I am still scared even though I am sort of successful now!	hit:10752_conv:21505_2_547
it's that fear of not being able to control everything that hurts the most	hit:10752_conv:21505_3_717
Uncertainty is the only certainty!	hit:10752_conv:21505_4_547
I like to work with people who are fast on their feet and get things very fast.	hit:10753_conv:21507_1_6
Have you always felt that way or have changed your view over time?	hit:10753_conv:21507_2_304
That is just me,we seem to get a lot of things done within a short period of time.	hit:10753_conv:21507_3_6
Well that is a good way of doing things as long are you getting the job right in my opinion.	hit:10753_conv:21507_4_304
i will release my project soon, and i'm so excited because i worked insanely hard on it	hit:10755_conv:21510_1_717

My new car was extremely damaged in a road accident last week being my very first car,i;m shuttered	hit:10756_conv:21513_1_6
I'm so sorry. : ( 	hit:10756_conv:21513_2_754
To make it worse,i was the one on the wrong. The insurance is seeming difficult to compensate.	hit:10756_conv:21513_3_6
Well, at least you came out without an injury? Or did you.	hit:10756_conv:21513_4_754
I'm very excited about this weekend. Two days with literally no plans and no responsibilities!	hit:10757_conv:21514_1_513
Dang! What are going to do with all that free time!?	hit:10757_conv:21514_2_547
The plan is to just relax. Maybe some TV or a book.	hit:10757_conv:21514_3_513
Nice! Well I hope you have a nice and relaxing weekend!	hit:10757_conv:21514_4_547
One time I found a cockroach in my hamburger! OMG!	hit:10757_conv:21515_1_547
Oh my god, that sounds like the most terrifying thing ever! Where was this so I know never to go there?	hit:10757_conv:21515_2_513
It was at Mcdonalds!	hit:10757_conv:21515_3_547
Not surprising. How long did it take you before you were able to eat a burger again?	hit:10757_conv:21515_4_513
i hate seeing all those people breaking their promises just so they can follow their desires and wishes	hit:10758_conv:21517_1_717
what kind of promises? who hurt you?	hit:10758_conv:21517_2_563
nobody hurted me , it's just seeing people get hurt is kind of annoying for me	hit:10758_conv:21517_3_717
what is the worst hurt you've ever seen?	hit:10758_conv:21517_4_563
nobody hurted me , it's just seeing people get hurt is kind of annoying for me	hit:10758_conv:21517_5_717

I was happy because my best friend called me to ask about his first time moving away from home.	hit:10759_conv:21518_1_158
Wow that sounds like good news!	hit:10759_conv:21518_2_77
Yeah. He was going to college. He went for a couple years. He didn't finish there. 	hit:10759_conv:21518_3_158
I'm glad to hear he has moved on with his life! A huge step forward.	hit:10759_conv:21518_4_77
Once I was going to get fried chicken, but then I remembered I was loyal to only eating vegetables	hit:10761_conv:21523_1_547
Wait, you forgot you're vegetarian? That must've been pretty shocking	hit:10761_conv:21523_2_710
My girlfriend makes me! And she is always watching!	hit:10761_conv:21523_3_547
Oooo you have to be sneaky with your meat habits, my friend	hit:10761_conv:21523_4_710
i love helping people, just seeing that smile after you finish helping them makes me so happy!	hit:10762_conv:21525_1_717
Who have you helped recently?	hit:10762_conv:21525_2_765
well, i always help this old man to cross the road.	hit:10762_conv:21525_3_717
That's really kind of you. Does the old man appreciate it?	hit:10762_conv:21525_4_765
well you see, i do it more for myself , i don't really mind if the other people appreciate it or not it's more for me to be a better person.	hit:10762_conv:21525_5_717
You are a good example to others.	hit:10762_conv:21525_6_765
I can tell my best friend anything!	hit:10764_conv:21529_1_547
Sounds like a great friend! Do they just listen or offer helpful advice?	hit:10764_conv:21529_2_710
I usually ask her for advice and tell her embarrassing stories because she never snitches!	hit:10764_conv:21529_3_547
Loyal and caring. You've got a winner on your hands!	hit:10764_conv:21529_4_710
"I;m living my best life. I could'not be any happier."""	hit:10765_conv:21530_1_6
good to know. and what makes you life so good, huh?	hit:10765_conv:21530_2_563
Family is doing great, bussines is booming	hit:10765_conv:21530_3_6
what if it all comes crashing down on you!	hit:10765_conv:21530_4_563
One time I stole something from the grocery store when I was little	hit:10766_conv:21533_1_547
Did your mother find out?	hit:10766_conv:21533_2_710
No, but the guilt haunted me for a long time!	hit:10766_conv:21533_3_547
How have you managed it? Have you thought about returning to the store and admitting to it?	hit:10766_conv:21533_4_710
There was a race in high school I should have won. I didn't see the guy trying to pass me as he was coming out of the last turn.	hit:10767_conv:21535_1_158
That sounds unfair. Maybe you'll get another chance to win.	hit:10767_conv:21535_2_77
The funny part was I threw the baton at the end and got my team disqualified for the race.	hit:10767_conv:21535_3_158
Oh wow, well there is always another chance, we all learn on mistakes.	hit:10767_conv:21535_4_77
In my spare time I like to watch tech reviewers on YouTube.  But whenever I see their high end gaming PC setups it makes me want something as good for myself.	hit:10769_conv:21539_1_403
I am not much of a gamer myself. What is your favourite game?	hit:10769_conv:21539_2_765
My favorite game is Assassin's Creed.  It has a great story.  When I see it running on a gamer's expensive PC I wish I could get that performance.	hit:10769_conv:21539_3_403
You need to save your money to be able to afford it.	hit:10769_conv:21539_4_765
"I let people so much in my life and they've ended up betraying my confidence i had in them."""	hit:10770_conv:21540_1_6
I can sympathize with you. I've had a lot of betrayal in the past. The ONLY thing to do is to continue looking for trustworthy individuals. 	hit:10770_conv:21540_2_710
I have learnt the hard way,keep your friend circle small.	hit:10770_conv:21540_3_6
Not for naught but, a dog won't ever betray you <3	hit:10770_conv:21540_4_710
One time I was building a tower of cards that was over 8 layers tall. It fell when someone walked by	hit:10771_conv:21542_1_547
oh my god, did it take a lot of work? and did it annoy you when it fell down?	hit:10771_conv:21542_2_717
Yes it took me over an hour! I was so mad!	hit:10771_conv:21542_3_547
maybe this time you can do it somewhere alone?	hit:10771_conv:21542_4_717
do you ever feel lonely? i do. i hate my own company and i have no friends.	hit:10771_conv:21543_1_717
Same. I hate my life. I sit in front of my computer all day	hit:10771_conv:21543_2_547
i do too, it's normal to runaway and sit in front of your computer i guess	hit:10771_conv:21543_3_717
Well I hope things turn out better for you	hit:10771_conv:21543_4_547
i'm ashamed of always deceiving my family.	hit:10772_conv:21544_1_717
why do you do it?	hit:10772_conv:21544_2_563
i don't do it on purpose , it's them they want me to be a doctor but i don't like medicine.	hit:10772_conv:21544_3_717
oh I see. what do you want to do instead?	hit:10772_conv:21544_4_563
i had a fight with my sibling today and she started shouting at me and it really annoyed me	hit:10775_conv:21550_1_717
That's unfortunate. Did you make up afterwards?	hit:10775_conv:21550_2_766
no, she still doesn't want to apologise for what she did, but eve she doesn't i'm gonna talk to her today!	hit:10775_conv:21550_3_717
That's good. You guys are siblings after all and should try to get along.	hit:10775_conv:21550_4_766
The possibility of winning a lottery this time is high for me	hit:10776_conv:21552_1_6
hi, what makes you think that?	hit:10776_conv:21552_2_767
Bruh,my instincts can't be wrong. I just have this crazy feeling that i might be lucky this time round.	hit:10776_conv:21552_3_6
fair enough my friend, would you say your chances are high because of signs of other people winning around you recently?	hit:10776_conv:21552_4_767
i recently discovered that my father is sick , i tried to contact my mother to see what happened but she didn't answer. i'm so mad at her because she didn't even try to call me again.	hit:10777_conv:21554_1_717
Could she just be too distraught to pick up a phone? I agree that she owes that much to you but, maybe shes too broken atm	hit:10777_conv:21554_2_710
i got really angry and i'm so worried about my father. so i'm gonna go visit my parents and check on them this weekend.	hit:10777_conv:21554_3_717
Hopefully you don't live too far. I know this is a random chat but, I genuinely hope your father is okay. I don't have a dad so, cherish every moment you get.	hit:10777_conv:21554_4_710
The coolest place I've ever been was an island in the Caribbean. No cars, only golf cars. 100% touristy village.	hit:10778_conv:21557_1_158
Golf is by far my favourite hobby, this sounds awesome! What island was it?	hit:10778_conv:21557_2_521
Caye Caulker. Maybe a vacation for your partner. There's a snorkeling place there. The coolest things though was that it was unlike anywhere I've ever been.	hit:10778_conv:21557_3_158
I will have a look at it on my lunch break today! I did snorkelling in the Philippines at it was amazing.  That was on the island of Coron	hit:10778_conv:21557_4_521
My embarassing moment is when our thermostat was broken and my boss came in, and I had my shirt off. Only problem I guess is it would have been weird if he had had a client with him.	hit:10780_conv:21561_1_158
Ooooof lmao do you work in an office?	hit:10780_conv:21561_2_710
Yeah, insurance. No client though thankfully.	hit:10780_conv:21561_3_158
Thank goodness. You really dodged a bullet on that one	hit:10780_conv:21561_4_710

well, I don't want to break it to you, but those guys are fictional....	hit:10781_conv:21562_4_563
I was nervous about a secret I had but I hated keeping it bottled up.	hit:10784_conv:21568_1_769
Did the secret negatively affect others?	hit:10784_conv:21568_2_710
No, but some kind person came up to me and promised not to tell anybody.	hit:10784_conv:21568_3_769
I can understand that feeling. Well, if it was pretty innocuous there's no harm and keeping confidentialiy	hit:10784_conv:21568_4_710
I am looking forward to getting a promotion. I have to hire 3 people.	hit:10786_conv:21572_1_158
Oh wow more responsibility! I bet the pay raise will be welcome	hit:10786_conv:21572_2_710

I was really close with my Grandpa on my father's side. I used to spend every summer with them when I was as child 	hit:10796_conv:21593_3_771

Why do you find it hard to throw away old stuff	hit:10801_conv:21603_2_520
Just thinking of all the good times I had with toys / books etc when I was a child! Even though I wouldn't use these things again, it was still hard to throw away 	hit:10801_conv:21603_3_771
So what are you planning to do	hit:10801_conv:21603_4_520
I ended up giving it to charity - that way someone else can have good times with them! 	hit:10801_conv:21603_5_771

I did apologise to him the next day, and I had a lot of making up to do. I don't usually get nasty when I drink alcohol, but this has made me be more careful 	hit:10804_conv:21608_3_771
i'm glad it made you more aware of what you're doing.	hit:10804_conv:21608_4_706

That's great that they let you work in exchange for lessons. I bet you have the best memories.	hit:10892_conv:21785_2_536
Yes I have very fond memories from those days.  I can still remember the smell of the farm and the smell of horses like it was yesterday.  I never wanted to wash the smell from my hands and I would daydream about owning my own horse someday.	hit:10892_conv:21785_3_587
That's awesome. Do you own a horse now?	hit:10892_conv:21785_4_536

Yeah, but theres a balance. study too much and you just burn yourself out	hit:10893_conv:21786_3_614
True. There has to be a work/school/life balance. 	hit:10893_conv:21786_4_292

He's better already but he got a real bad fever during that week	hit:10895_conv:21790_3_614
You should keep an eye on him older people are more prone to getting sick.	hit:10895_conv:21790_4_650
I drank all the milk in the fridge and left nothing for anyone else. Next week I will buy extra milk for the house to make up for it.	hit:10900_conv:21801_1_725
That's very considerate of you. I know some people that drink it all and don't replace it.	hit:10900_conv:21801_2_128
Yeah, I have done that before and I got yelled at by everyone. I learned my lesson. Haha	hit:10900_conv:21801_3_725
Lol it happens, what's important is that you learned and care enough about your people to internalize the knowledge.	hit:10900_conv:21801_4_128
Looking through old stuff in the attic and stumbled across my old gamecube, sadly it didn't work anymore.	hit:10903_conv:21806_1_614

My old roommate didn't clean out his room or kitchen when he left. My school charged the rest of us $100 because of him.	hit:10905_conv:21811_1_614
Wow, thats terrible. Did you get him to pay you all back?	hit:10905_conv:21811_2_231
No, he cut off all communication. Nobody liked him anyways, he was dirty and rude.	hit:10905_conv:21811_3_614

I'm sorry. It sucks when you put time and effort into studying but the grade is bad. Could you get help from your teacher or a study buddy?	hit:10907_conv:21815_2_536
Yea i had a study group I just panicked when i entered the testing room i think. It's not so bad though, i still passed the class.	hit:10907_conv:21815_3_614

Aw, I know that must be hard having to take care of yourself so far from loved ones that you can depend on.	hit:10908_conv:21816_2_128
Yes it is quite hard. But it has been my choice to move away. I guess one day I will return but not sure when.	hit:10908_conv:21816_3_725
That's good that you are keeping your options open and even better that you challenged yourself to leave comfort and travel.	hit:10908_conv:21816_4_128
Yeah that is my personality for sure. At least I will have lots of stories to tell one day! 	hit:10908_conv:21816_5_725
One time in high school I sat in chocolate sauce! I didn't have a sweater to tie around my waste, so I had to borrow one from a friend.	hit:10909_conv:21818_1_573
Oh no! that's horrifying in high school! I hope you didn't get made fun of.	hit:10909_conv:21818_2_659
One of the bully kids noticed the sweater around my waste on the warm day and knew something was up. He really tried to embarrass me.	hit:10909_conv:21818_3_573
Kids can be so mean. Thank God that's all behind us now!	hit:10909_conv:21818_4_659
Recently moved to a new dorm and when i came in the kitchen was a total disaster. Months old piles of dishes in the sink with mold and dried up old food on the stove.	hit:10910_conv:21821_1_614
Holy crap! Is there not a landlord or something you can complain to?	hit:10910_conv:21821_2_231
I can but they take forever to come and clean it up. I just talked to the guy who did it and he said he won't do it again. Spent  an hour cleaning it all up with a lot of clorox, alcohol, and soap.	hit:10910_conv:21821_3_614

It's easier to maintain than people realize!	hit:10912_conv:21825_3_588

I was driving down the highway during a heavy thunderstorm and two cars crashed in front of me and one flipped over.	hit:10914_conv:21828_1_614
Oh my goodness! That is scary! Are you alright? Did anyone get hurt?	hit:10914_conv:21828_2_725

Whew! You are lucky! Glad to hear everyone was ok. 	hit:10914_conv:21828_4_725

Oh no! Did you guys stillhave a nice evening?	hit:10915_conv:21831_4_659
Yeah, it worked out okay to take the kids with. It just wasn't quite as relaxing.	hit:10915_conv:21831_5_305
Yeah I thought of that. well, the kids probably loved it!	hit:10915_conv:21831_6_659

That sounds so nice!  Are you very far from grocery stores and stuff?	hit:10917_conv:21834_2_527
Only about a 30 minute drive. Not to close and not to far. But we grow some of our food here and we have cows and chickens too.	hit:10917_conv:21834_3_725
Yeah, that's not too bad at all!  Sounds idyllic!	hit:10917_conv:21834_4_527

I feel anxious when I have to wait for people that are late. Why can't everyone just be on time?	hit:10921_conv:21842_1_725
I feel exactly the same way.  People should be more considerate and be on time for the sake of others.	hit:10921_conv:21842_2_254
Yes totally agree! Maybe I should just leave and make them wait. Haha	hit:10921_conv:21842_3_725
Yes, that would certainly give them a taste of their own medicine!	hit:10921_conv:21842_4_254
It's really hard to stay disciplined and watch what you eat.	hit:10926_conv:21852_1_305
I agree, it's something I struggle with as well. Have you tried an diets you liked?	hit:10926_conv:21852_2_35
I haven't done anything specific with diets, no.  Have you found one that you like?	hit:10926_conv:21852_3_305
I've tried a few, and I would have to say the one that I liked the most was Weight Watchers. It's pretty easy to stay on, and the food is usually good. The only big problem is that it gets expensive.	hit:10926_conv:21852_4_35
I think that that's a common problem with all of them.	hit:10926_conv:21852_5_305

It's scary how quick our mind goes to the worst possible scenarios.|oh yeah that must have been a good time|People like that should just do shopping online instead of ruining the experience for everyone else!|Wow, that's very nice of him! Was there a lot of people there?|Yes, I a, referring to the animal, dog.|I live out in a rural area where people don't always have control of their dogs.  Sometimes those little ankle-biting dogs will start chasing the car and they make a break for the car and it makes one really fearful that you'll hit them.|Not for naught but, a dog won't ever betray you <3|I thought it would be normal. Good thing to be cautious. |Wow, that sounds fun. What type of artwork did you see?|That is awesome. Congratulations. Im sure you earned every penny.|That's amazing!  Congratulations!

Why? |What is the job?|Wow, what brand|well if this isn't a great start for summer i don't know what is|That sounds like a good plan.

There a way your brain reward you with good feeling |That sounds great! I really pays off to be prepared. |That is very cool! How much did it cost?|I was scared the first and only time I flew also. Where were you flying to?|That's still really good! She did better than 25 other people. |I see. Well, it seems as people get older they want to go back to places which reminds them of past.

I don't like to perform in front of people either. Did you decline?|Nice, Was it hard to start?|I think it's a good outlook.|Be careful while negotiating your pay raise. Some managers may find it too intrusive and that may leave bad impression on them|Oh no! that's horrifying in high school! I hope you didn't get made fun of.|Oh I see, well good luck to you, I hope you'll solve it soon.|Oh wow, I think it'd take me much longer to not bust my butt! That is impressive!

i was on the verge of something more serious and probably would have regret it	hit:10946_conv:21893_3_675
Yeah, I'm glad you didn't do anything you would regret. I hope he is better for you in the future.	hit:10946_conv:21893_4_659
I am so hurt that my baby goat died. My dogs were playing to rough and killer her. Man I should have stopped it sooner. It is all my fault. :(	hit:10947_conv:21895_1_725
Oh no! I'm so sorry about that. Don't blame yourself, animals like to play with each other!	hit:10947_conv:21895_2_670
Yes but I think I could have avoided it. I am training my dogs now to stay away from the goats. I hope it doesn't happen again.	hit:10947_conv:21895_3_725
That sounds like a good plan. You definitely don't want that to happen again. Sometimes bad things happen in order for us to learn and avoid it again.	hit:10947_conv:21895_4_670
I went fishing with my 4 year-old about a month ago.	hit:10948_conv:21897_1_305
That sounds great, I can remeber going fishing with my dad at that age. Did your 4 year-old have a good time?	hit:10948_conv:21897_2_35
He did!  He caught 4 fish all by himself.	hit:10948_conv:21897_3_305
Wow, that's impressive! I'm glad he had a good time.	hit:10948_conv:21897_4_35
My dog was stung by a bug.  His lip got huge and looked really funny but I felt terrible for him!	hit:10950_conv:21900_1_318
Poor doggy! Did you have to take him to the vet?	hit:10950_conv:21900_2_35
I did end up taking him in. Luckily it wasnt too serious and he was fine a couple days later.  He looked so sad with his big lip!	hit:10950_conv:21900_3_318
I bet he did, I'm glad he's okay though.	hit:10950_conv:21900_4_35
my best friend friend helped me through some rough spots with my marriage and job. I am gland he was there for me	hit:10951_conv:21903_1_675
Thats really nice you have a friend like that.That's hard to come by. I hope everything is better for you now.	hit:10951_conv:21903_2_659
thank you, i do not know how i will repay him back, I will always be in his debt	hit:10951_conv:21903_3_675
I'm sure he doesn't expect it but thats a really nice thing he did.	hit:10951_conv:21903_4_659
I feel so bad to see so many homeless people on the streets these days. I hope I am never homeless.	hit:10953_conv:21906_1_725
I hope you arent and I'm not too! It would be rough living on the streets.	hit:10953_conv:21906_2_318
Yeah especially when it is snowing outside. Can you just imagine having to sleep outside like that . Oh! So sad!	hit:10953_conv:21906_3_725
It would be terrible in the winter.  I cant imagine sleeping outside when its freezing	hit:10953_conv:21906_4_318
I went out to eat with my girlfriend last week.  It was an awesome atmosphere and the food was great!	hit:10953_conv:21907_1_318
That sounds fun! Where did you go?	hit:10953_conv:21907_2_725
We went to a greek place.  There were belly dancers and a ton of good meats and appetizers. I think we'll check it out again this weekend since it was so fun!	hit:10953_conv:21907_3_318
Mmmmm, I love greek food! That sounds appetizing! I think I will take my girl there too this week!	hit:10953_conv:21907_4_725
as I walk through my house, the rooms are empty, There is no one there for me	hit:10955_conv:21911_1_675
I'm so sorry you feel that way. Maybe you should talk to someone you trust. A family member or a friend.	hit:10955_conv:21911_2_536
that is the problem there is no one I can talk to or share with	hit:10955_conv:21911_3_675
I'm sorry. You could seek out a professional to talk to. Or you could just try meeting some new people.	hit:10955_conv:21911_4_536
I have no children but I have a ton of animals. I love them all so much. They are my children.	hit:10956_conv:21913_1_725
What kinds of pets do you have?	hit:10956_conv:21913_2_659
I have chickens, ducks, parrots, cockatiels, budgies, peacocks, guinea pigs, dogs, goats and cows. haha 	hit:10956_conv:21913_3_725
oh wow! you did say a ton! I love animals too. wish I lived somewhere I could have more.	hit:10956_conv:21913_4_659
Yeah, it is so much fun to live with animals. :)	hit:10956_conv:21913_5_725
When my son was born, we knew that something was up before he came out.  It was pretty scary.	hit:10957_conv:21914_1_305
Did he have superpowers?	hit:10957_conv:21914_2_543
Hah - no.  But he did have the cord wrapped around his neck twice, and he'd tied an overhand knot in it, too.	hit:10957_conv:21914_3_305
That's pretty impressive.	hit:10957_conv:21914_4_543
I was in a rush this morning and I dressed my self in stained clothes. I feel so dirty today. :(	hit:10959_conv:21919_1_725
Oh wow, are you going to be in front of anyone important?	hit:10959_conv:21919_2_387
Not today. I just feel insecure about it, like everyone is looking at me. It is probably just all in my head.	hit:10959_conv:21919_3_725
Usually, you are the one who notices it the most. 	hit:10959_conv:21919_4_387
My cows are finally pregnant. I can't wait for my baby calves to be born!	hit:10963_conv:21927_1_725
wow, that must be an interesting thing to be involved with. lots of milk too, i presume.	hit:10963_conv:21927_2_290
Oh, yes! Fresh raw milk is so wonderful and one of the best foods we can eat.	hit:10963_conv:21927_3_725
very cool, wish i could get into something like that. sounds fun	hit:10963_conv:21927_4_290
i miss my old pet dog, i feel so empty without her around	hit:10964_conv:21929_1_675
Awww, I understand. Dogs are sooo great to be around and they are super friendly. 	hit:10964_conv:21929_2_470
i know that what makes it harder not having her around, no companionship	hit:10964_conv:21929_3_675
Maybe also looking into getting a new dog, I know it's hard, but you can get through it! Your friends and family are always there as well.	hit:10964_conv:21929_4_470
I am so envious of those that can travel the world and get paid for it.	hit:10966_conv:21933_1_725
That sounds like such an enjoyable life. If only it was so easy!	hit:10966_conv:21933_2_387
Yeah, maybe in my next life I guess, haha.	hit:10966_conv:21933_3_725
Haha, that is true. But we have to make the most of this one. 	hit:10966_conv:21933_4_387
When I was in high school there was a senior I had a crush on and I was a sophomore.  I ended up asking her out but got rejected. Later on in college we actually became pretty good friends.	hit:10967_conv:21934_1_318
Oh man heart breaker. Thats good yall are friends though. You never know maybe one day yall will be married	hit:10967_conv:21934_2_554
Haha, I hope not...my current girlfriend would probably be a little upset! She's a nice person (the one from high school) but I dont think I could ever marry her	hit:10967_conv:21934_3_318
you dont still have any feelings at all for her?	hit:10967_conv:21934_4_554
I am learning how sew my own clothes. I am studying hard and I think I will be able to make my first outfit!	hit:10969_conv:21939_1_725
Ooh, I've always wanted to learn how to do that. You must be so excited!	hit:10969_conv:21939_2_659
Yes, I have so many ideas! How cool it would be to not have to buy any more expensive clothes and make my own! 	hit:10969_conv:21939_3_725
Omg, that would be awesome. I might just have to learn how to do that myself.	hit:10969_conv:21939_4_659
I just made a huge feast and now I am excited for all my guests to arrive to my baby shower!	hit:10971_conv:21943_1_725
Ooo! That's exciting! Congrats on your baby! I hope your guests enjoy their time. 	hit:10971_conv:21943_2_670
Thank you! I have so many fun games planned and lots of great food.	hit:10971_conv:21943_3_725
Yay! That sounds like so much fun. Baby showers are a great way to bring everyone together.	hit:10971_conv:21943_4_670
I trust the way my body feels to know if I'm generally healthy or not	hit:10972_conv:21944_1_588
Usually it will let you know if something is wrong. Part of how we are designed! 	hit:10972_conv:21944_2_387
Exactly! The human body is interesting!	hit:10972_conv:21944_3_588
It is, everything has to be balanced just right, or else we feel it.	hit:10972_conv:21944_4_387
I went to a restaurant and after I got the bill I realized that I did not have my wallet on me! The manager was yelling at me demanding me to pay before I left.	hit:10974_conv:21948_1_725
Oh no, how did you make things right with the manager. I am sure he is just wanting to get paid. 	hit:10974_conv:21948_2_387
Yes, he did want to get paid but I needed to go home and get my wallet. He got angry with me but what could I do? I had no money with me.	hit:10974_conv:21948_3_725
That is a tough spot to be in, maybe you could of washed dishes for him. Or give him your phone for collateral. 	hit:10974_conv:21948_4_387
I just left but I came straight back and paid. All was fine in the end. But I will never go to that restaurant again.	hit:10974_conv:21948_5_725
That is good, such an embarrassing situation to be in.	hit:10974_conv:21948_6_387
I really wanted an Oculus Rift.  I saved up enough and had to wait about a week before it was in stock at the store	hit:10975_conv:21951_1_318
Oh man I want that too! did you get it?	hit:10975_conv:21951_2_554
I did!  It is by far the coolest thing I have ever bought!	hit:10975_conv:21951_3_318
Do you use your computer?	hit:10975_conv:21951_4_554
yeah, I have it plugged into my computer.  I cant tell you, or even begin to explain, how real everything feels when you use it.	hit:10975_conv:21951_5_318
How much do they go for?	hit:10975_conv:21951_6_554
It was $400, having a computer that can run it is the expensive piece	hit:10975_conv:21951_7_318
thats not bad. I have a rx 280 	hit:10975_conv:21951_8_554
I had to help my dad move some heavy stuff around this past weekend.	hit:10978_conv:21956_1_305
Moving, is always such a pain. Did it go smoothly at least?	hit:10978_conv:21956_2_35
Yeah.  He kept up with me pretty well.	hit:10978_conv:21956_3_305
That's good, glad he wasn't having too tough a time.	hit:10978_conv:21956_4_35
my neighbor dog is always barking, I can't stand it	hit:10979_conv:21958_1_675
Oh man, I can't stand barking dogs. I wish owners would do something to shut them up. 	hit:10979_conv:21958_2_387
i know the worst part is my bedroom is near the fence and the dog barks all night 	hit:10979_conv:21958_3_675
That can make it so hard to sleep at night. 	hit:10979_conv:21958_4_387
When I was a little girl my favorite childhood character was Strawberry Shortcake. I miss those days smelling my little figurines that smelled like strawberries.	hit:10983_conv:21966_1_725
Aw man, childhood is full of good memories! I love the smell of strawberries. 	hit:10983_conv:21966_2_387
Yeah, I also remember having my strawberry shortcake themed birthday party. There were strawberries everywhere! I bet you could guess what flavor the cake and ice cream were, lol.	hit:10983_conv:21966_3_725
Haha, clearly strawberry. Sounds like you had an enjoyable childhood! 	hit:10983_conv:21966_4_387
my neighbor dog barks all day, I like to go over there and tell him where he can put that dog at,	hit:10984_conv:21969_1_675
Your neighbor doesn't do anything about his dogs?	hit:10984_conv:21969_2_90
that is the problem, he does nothing, except give me his little mustache smile, one of these days i'll wipe that smile off his face	hit:10984_conv:21969_3_675
If it were me, I'd call the animal shelter and report possible abuse since the dog does nothing but bark all day - poor thing just needs attention and the owner isn't taking care of it.	hit:10984_conv:21969_4_90
I feel so sad to see the world in the state that it is in but I am confident that times are changing and humanity is actually good.	hit:10987_conv:21974_1_725
Really depends on the person I think. You can't have good people without bad people.	hit:10987_conv:21974_2_588
Yes that is true. The ying and the yang. But I think most people are good though.	hit:10987_conv:21974_3_725
Agreed!	hit:10987_conv:21974_4_588
My childhood was great. I have mainly positive memories of it.	hit:10987_conv:21975_1_588
You are very lucky my friend. There are so many children out there that cannot say the same, sadly. But so happy for you!	hit:10987_conv:21975_2_725
Yeah life ends up pretty dark for tons of people. It's slightly absurd when you think far into it!	hit:10987_conv:21975_3_588
I guess it all comes down to karma, if you believe in that stuff...... I do. :)	hit:10987_conv:21975_4_725
I decided to try and get some projects knocked out a couple of nights ago, but needed to keep my kids occupied.	hit:10990_conv:21980_1_305
what did you end up doing?	hit:10990_conv:21980_2_671
Luckily, my wife was willing to keep them busy.  Even after she had a crazy day!	hit:10990_conv:21980_3_305
It's good to have a partner. 	hit:10990_conv:21980_4_671
My wife took the kids over to her mother's one evening before I got home from work.  I thought it'd be pretty nice to have a quiet house for once.	hit:10992_conv:21985_1_305
I have a son, it's definitely nice to have some peace and quiet.	hit:10992_conv:21985_2_349
It was for a while, but it was too quiet for me!  I've gotten used to the noise.	hit:10992_conv:21985_3_305
You must have been very happy when they returned home.	hit:10992_conv:21985_4_349
I tried for a promotion at work recently.  It's been a while since I've gotten a raise, so I worked pretty hard at it.	hit:10995_conv:21991_1_305
Did you get it?	hit:10995_conv:21991_2_671
No, they ended up giving it to someone with less experience.	hit:10995_conv:21991_3_305
That's disappointing. I feel sorry for you. 	hit:10995_conv:21991_4_671
I went to the casino with my brother and the only thing he could do was win! The only thing I could do was lose.	hit:10997_conv:21994_1_318
That sounds like a bummer. Hopefully, you did not lose too much.	hit:10997_conv:21994_2_721
Nope, I'm a little careful when I go out there.  It would have been nice to join in on the winning though!	hit:10997_conv:21994_3_318
Yeah, but it is a good thing to hear you did not lose too much. Some people put all the money on the line.	hit:10997_conv:21994_4_721
I interviewed for a job.  I know I gave great answers to their questions and walked away feeling like the job was mine.	hit:11001_conv:22002_1_318
Hey, that's awesome! I hope you get it. When do you hear?	hit:11001_conv:22002_2_410
Probably next week sometime. I'm really excited!	hit:11001_conv:22002_3_318
Well I hope you do. What kind of job is it?	hit:11001_conv:22002_4_410
I work in tech support.  One issue I was given the details before and got to do research before I worked with the customer.  It was great knowing what to do before it happened.	hit:11009_conv:22018_1_318
You must have been relieved you were able to help. Did all go as plan?	hit:11009_conv:22018_2_557
yeah! I pretty much knew all the steps that I needed to do before everything started and there werent any surprise issues which was awesome.	hit:11009_conv:22018_3_318
That's awesome! I'm glad it went through without a hitch!	hit:11009_conv:22018_4_557
my girlfriend just got promoted at her job. I am really glad for her.	hit:11010_conv:22020_1_675
Oh, that's terrific! What a great feeling that is, to be appreciated and valued!	hit:11010_conv:22020_2_239
i knew she could and would get the promotion, i feel like i am going to burst 	hit:11010_conv:22020_3_675
Oh, I love that you are so happy for her! You sound like such a supportive and loving partner!	hit:11010_conv:22020_4_239
I have been working on potty training my dog and she has been doing great! Last night though she went a TON in the house right after I brought her out.	hit:11025_conv:22050_1_318
I also have two older puppies, training takes time and care and love.	hit:11025_conv:22050_2_786
It definitely does!  I have one older puppy that I got through potty training.  This one is just taking a little extra time.	hit:11025_conv:22050_3_318
Puppies are smart believe it or not, use treats and don't yell or punish for their mistakes. A change of tone and placing them outside works really well.	hit:11025_conv:22050_4_786
I was packing up things to move from my girlfriends house and found her son's lite brite.  It reminded me of my childhood and playing with that toy.	hit:11028_conv:22057_1_318
i remember the lite brite toy. it was a nice toy to have.	hit:11028_conv:22057_2_743
It really was! The toys back then seemed to have lasted a lot longer than the toys now too!	hit:11028_conv:22057_3_318
i agree, the toys now days are made cheaply and of poor quality. everything is about video games. 	hit:11028_conv:22057_4_743
I had a move a couple weekends ago.  I was really planning on getting everything done, or at least moved over, in one weekend.	hit:11032_conv:22064_1_318
Moving can be stressful for sure, hopefully you had some help?	hit:11032_conv:22064_2_290
yeah, the help was great and we did end up getting everything over.  Now the fun part is unpacking the boxes!	hit:11032_conv:22064_3_318
It's like christmas! only you already know whats in the boxes. the best part about moving is you can have a fresh start on organization. 	hit:11032_conv:22064_4_290
I had a great weekend with my son, we did a ton of fun things.  At the end of the weekend his attitude changed and he didnt want to listen at all.	hit:11037_conv:22074_1_318
That's not good!  What did you do to try to get him to listen again?	hit:11037_conv:22074_2_458
I made a deal that if he went to bed he would get tablet time the next day and if he didnt then he wouldnt get any time	hit:11037_conv:22074_3_318
I bet that worked!	hit:11037_conv:22074_4_458
My dog went number 2 in the middle of the night inside.  The next morning she threw up everything...it was the worst smelling pile of stuff I've ever smelled.	hit:11039_conv:22079_1_318
Oh man, i'm about to eat dinner over here! lol that's pretty gross. My cat pukes up stuff all the time so i can kind of relate.	hit:11039_conv:22079_2_290
Sorry about that! Yeah, it was a terrible thing to wake up to!	hit:11039_conv:22079_3_318
I bet, hope the dog is feeling better though.	hit:11039_conv:22079_4_290
I used to have a boxer puppy that was so sweet and adorable.  HOwever he had on issue that I could not stand.	hit:11041_conv:22082_1_587
interesting, what was the issue?	hit:11041_conv:22082_2_675
Well when he was during the potty training stage he would often poop on the floor.   HOwever he would then eat it!!!!!   I could smell it but not find it anywhere.   He would come running into the living room wanting to lick you on the face with poop breath!	hit:11041_conv:22082_3_587
oh man, that is an issue, i hope he grows out of it	hit:11041_conv:22082_4_675
next week my vacation starts. I am really looking forward to it	hit:11041_conv:22083_1_675
I bet you cant wait.  WHere are going for your vacation?	hit:11041_conv:22083_2_587
i always wanted to visit Miami, i can't wait to visit the beach and take in all  the fun	hit:11041_conv:22083_3_675
Miami sounds like a great place to go for a vacation.   I wish I was going with you!	hit:11041_conv:22083_4_587
One of my coworkers was outright belligerent today.	hit:11042_conv:22085_1_305
That sucks! What were they upset about?	hit:11042_conv:22085_2_349
I don't even know!  She does that sometimes, and just badgers you.  I can't figure out what fires her up.	hit:11042_conv:22085_3_305
It sounds like a very challenging environment to work in.	hit:11042_conv:22085_4_349
My girlfriend is moving in.  I was pretty calm when we first started talking about it.  I'm really excited but there is so much to pack up!	hit:11044_conv:22089_1_318
That's exciting! When will she be moving in?	hit:11044_conv:22089_2_630
In 2 weeks.  It'll come up fast, I think thats why I'm starting to get a little more nervous.  Its not even her, its just the move that will not be fun	hit:11044_conv:22089_3_318
Does she live far away?	hit:11044_conv:22089_4_630
My wife and I are trying to build a house, and keep running into delays getting the permits.	hit:11045_conv:22090_1_305
That sounds very frustrating.	hit:11045_conv:22090_2_349
It is!  The guy at the city could care less if he helps us out.	hit:11045_conv:22090_3_305
Hopefully you'll able to get it all sorted out soon.  I'm sure when it's done it'll be a beautiful house.	hit:11045_conv:22090_4_349
I was home alone last night playing a VR game.  It took a really creepy turn that I really wasnt expecting at all.	hit:11046_conv:22093_1_318
What happened?	hit:11046_conv:22093_2_349
It was a duck hunting game and all of a sudden the dog from the game killed my mom and started coming after me.  I dont know if you've ever tried VR but everything feels SO real.  It was pretty scary	hit:11046_conv:22093_3_318
I've never tried VR, but just imagining that is scaring me away from it.	hit:11046_conv:22093_4_349
a job I applied and interview for a couple of months ago offered me the job. It was unexpected.	hit:11054_conv:22108_1_675
Congrats!  How exciting for you.	hit:11054_conv:22108_2_746
thank you, when they called, I did not know who it was at first, then it was, wow I got the job	hit:11054_conv:22108_3_675
That's a long time to hold out hope.  I bet you were shocked.	hit:11054_conv:22108_4_746
My husband, I think you've met him, he's been having a hard time finding a job recently. He's been in the final two candidates THREE times but no luck!	hit:11059_conv:22118_1_791
It always takes time. Hang in there It will all work out.	hit:11059_conv:22118_2_14
Well, he's got another interview on Thursday. I just know he will get that one!	hit:11059_conv:22118_3_791
I bet so too!  Good luck to you both.	hit:11059_conv:22118_4_14
i needed help with choosing a subject to major and my brother helped	hit:11106_conv:22212_1_178
What subject did you choose?	hit:11106_conv:22212_2_495
I chose finance and economics	hit:11106_conv:22212_3_178
Nice choice. I guess you have good relationship with your brother.	hit:11106_conv:22212_4_495
I felt ashamed seeing the police officer yelling at the old lady	hit:11108_conv:22217_1_178
why was the officer yelling at her?	hit:11108_conv:22217_2_280
She was trying to cross the road and accidentally had her phone fall, the officer thought she was insane	hit:11108_conv:22217_3_178
wow, that's unfortunate. i would feel embarrassed for the lady	hit:11108_conv:22217_4_280
My mother has been a caring mom since i got ill a week ago	hit:11126_conv:22252_1_178
That's so wonderful. I love being cared for when I am ill.	hit:11126_conv:22252_2_799
Yah, i feel loved so much	hit:11126_conv:22252_3_178
It is an amazing thing to have a loving mother. Everyone should show more appreciation to their moms.	hit:11126_conv:22252_4_799
I had to walk home from work last night after I got off late at night, it was kind of scary.	hit:11126_conv:22253_1_799
Sorry about that, you could have taken a taxi	hit:11126_conv:22253_2_178
It was a short enough walk, I just stayed aware of my surroundings and got home safe.	hit:11126_conv:22253_3_799
good enough you got home safe	hit:11126_conv:22253_4_178
Today I was looking through my childhood photos and writings, it made me a little emotional and nostalgic.	hit:11128_conv:22257_1_799
Did you have a good childhood? You must miss a lot of things.	hit:11128_conv:22257_2_766
I think I had a good childhood. I love that I have many photos that I ca look back on.	hit:11128_conv:22257_3_799
Yes. Nostalgia is unavoidable when we look back on our youth.	hit:11128_conv:22257_4_766
I slept through a really important class because I was hungover and I failed because of it. I should've behaved better.	hit:11130_conv:22260_1_799
That's unfortunate. But at least you learned from the experience, right?	hit:11130_conv:22260_2_766
I sure did. I am just embarrassed that I did that, I am not usually that way. It was out of character for me.	hit:11130_conv:22260_3_799
No need to feel ashamed. We all make mistakes and at least you learned your lesson.	hit:11130_conv:22260_4_766
I had to care for my younger brother last week while he was sick. I tried my best to make him as comfortable as possible. 	hit:11131_conv:22262_1_799
That's nice that you helped him. I'm sure he appreciated it!	hit:11131_conv:22262_2_239
He did, he is nice and well now. I just know how horrible it is to be sick, it helps to have someone to care for you.	hit:11131_conv:22262_3_799
Yes, it really does. I am sure if you get sick, he will remember and do the same for you!	hit:11131_conv:22262_4_239
I once got in a really bad accident on my way home from work and it really upset me	hit:11134_conv:22268_1_411
Wow! Were you hurt? Was anyone else hurt?	hit:11134_conv:22268_2_536
luckily the only problem I had was my neck was sore for a few weeks but nobody else was hurt	hit:11134_conv:22268_3_411
That's good news at least. I hope you are feeling better now. And don't be hard on yourself, accidents happen.	hit:11134_conv:22268_4_536
Hi! I had a great day with my emotions with my child going to school!	hit:11145_conv:22290_1_803
Oh that's great, its awesome when the kids go off to school each year.	hit:11145_conv:22290_2_127
Yes - this is m child's first year and it was pretty difficult for me to let someone take care of him instead of me. You know how it is! Parent life.	hit:11145_conv:22290_3_803
You'll get used to it and begin to appreciate your quiet time, haha.	hit:11145_conv:22290_4_127
Yes!  I'm already enjoying it!  How are you doing?	hit:11145_conv:22290_5_803
I just had a weird experience at Wal-Mart today!	hit:11147_conv:22295_1_803
Wal-Mart is a place where weirdness always happens. Can you tell me what happened, I'm dying to know!	hit:11147_conv:22295_2_381
Well, I was parked pretty close and a guy came up to ask me for gas money!  There was a gas station a small walk away though!	hit:11147_conv:22295_3_803
Do you think he was panhandling you for money or a person who really needed it? Did you give him money?	hit:11147_conv:22295_4_381
I didn't have any cash on me.  He got out of a vehicle that had two other guys in it...staring at me!	hit:11147_conv:22295_5_803
I'm going to cut to the chase here. Just blurt it on. My DRESS blew up in front of parents and children the other day when it was windy.	hit:11150_conv:22301_1_803
That must have been a very windy day!	hit:11150_conv:22301_2_14
I wanted to run and hide.  I haven't' worn a dress since.  	hit:11150_conv:22301_3_803
I bet It will teach you.	hit:11150_conv:22301_4_14
Oh it did.  I learned my lesson.	hit:11150_conv:22301_5_803
i felt great last year when i started going to church again	hit:11151_conv:22302_1_12
I go to church every Sunday I love it.	hit:11151_conv:22302_2_14
yeah its a great feeling getting back into church !	hit:11151_conv:22302_3_12
The people you can meet are super.	hit:11151_conv:22302_4_14
I felt very grateful last week when an elderly women paid for my gas 	hit:11160_conv:22320_1_12
That	hit:11160_conv:22320_2_801
Yeah its nice when people do kind things like this it doesn't happen very often now day	hit:11160_conv:22320_3_12
That is really not thing. I wish more people would do such nice thing. I know that made your day.	hit:11160_conv:22320_4_801
When I lived on my own, I found it hard without having any company	hit:11164_conv:22329_1_771
So you don't like to be alone. I am so sorry that affects you. So what would you do? 	hit:11164_conv:22329_2_653
I was used to having family or friends around most of the time in my old place, but then I moved away. I had to make new friends which I found very difficult	hit:11164_conv:22329_3_771
Yes, usually when one relocates it's hard to make new friends, but eventually it will happen.	hit:11164_conv:22329_4_653
I eventually made friends through work, and it is really nice when my old friends come to visit too 	hit:11164_conv:22329_5_771
That was really nice of your old friends.	hit:11164_conv:22329_6_653
I love the gifts that i received last week on my birthday	hit:11165_conv:22330_1_178
Happy birthday. What was your favorite gift?	hit:11165_conv:22330_2_804
A pair of shoe	hit:11165_conv:22330_3_178
Nice. What brand of shoes were they?	hit:11165_conv:22330_4_804
I felt a bit sad last week when i saw an elderly man drop his wallet and a kid picked it up and didn't give it back to the man	hit:11168_conv:22336_1_12
That's terrible. Were you able to identify the kid?	hit:11168_conv:22336_2_804
Yeah eventually the kid was caught i told the man and he caught him shortly after	hit:11168_conv:22336_3_12
I'm glad he was able to catch him.	hit:11168_conv:22336_4_804
I saw the movie trailer about Paul Walker's life today. It made me so sad!	hit:11171_conv:22342_1_803
Wow, how was it? I have never seen that trailer. 	hit:11171_conv:22342_2_631
It was just sad. I love Paul Walker and his movies. I still remember hearing about him passing away in the same way he became famous. In a fast car.	hit:11171_conv:22342_3_803
Aww, that is so sad to hear. He must have made some great movies! 	hit:11171_conv:22342_4_631
Oh he did!  I think the one about candy cane and the truck driver was my favorite. I can't remember the name.	hit:11171_conv:22342_5_803
Speaking of babies, I got to meet my nephews yesterday!	hit:11174_conv:22349_1_803
Are they twins?!	hit:11174_conv:22349_2_809
Yes!  They are so sweet. I don't even like kids and I really felt my heart warm up to them.	hit:11174_conv:22349_3_803
Awww! Twins seem like a handful but also very exciting at the same time!	hit:11174_conv:22349_4_809
The other day something happened that made me want to run and hide.	hit:11177_conv:22355_1_803
Oh, I'm sorry. What happened?	hit:11177_conv:22355_2_536
It didn't happen to me directly, but my husband passed GAS while we were shopping. Everyone was staring.	hit:11177_conv:22355_3_803
I can imagine that you did want to run and hide. Sometimes husbands get us into all kinds of situations.	hit:11177_conv:22355_4_536
My girlfriend and I were watching a series on Netflix.  She wasnt home and I ended up watching a couple episodes ahead of where we were at.	hit:11178_conv:22356_1_318
I've been in that situation before. Did she find out about it? 	hit:11178_conv:22356_2_808
She didnt say anything but I think she knew.  I mean, I still watched the episodes that she missed with her!	hit:11178_conv:22356_3_318
Well that's all that matters. If she was okay with it. I'm sure she was happy watching the episodes with you, even if you had already watched them. 	hit:11178_conv:22356_4_808
I moved last weekend.  I was really happy once everything was done and it went smoothly.	hit:11181_conv:22363_1_318
That sounds like a bit of work. Are you adjusting to your place now?	hit:11181_conv:22363_2_128
Yeah, unpacking and all that fun stuff now.  I really like the new place though.	hit:11181_conv:22363_3_318
That's what's most important. I'm glad everything has gone well.	hit:11181_conv:22363_4_128
I'm not in a good mood! My husband got to go to a basketball game. I wish I could have too!	hit:11184_conv:22368_1_803
Oh, I'm sorry. Why didn't you get to go with him?	hit:11184_conv:22368_2_390
I have to stay home with our son.  It is hard for us to find a baby sitter for him.	hit:11184_conv:22368_3_803
Oh, that's too bad. I know exactly how you feel. Hopefully your husband will watch your son another night so you can go have some fun. 	hit:11184_conv:22368_4_390
I went to a friend's wedding this weekend!	hit:11186_conv:22372_1_803
Was it a lot of fun?	hit:11186_conv:22372_2_806
Oh gosh yes. I wore a beautiful dress. I felt so pretty!	hit:11186_conv:22372_3_803
That's great, but you don't have to wear a fancy dress to be beautiful. I'm sure you're gorgeous no matter what you wear!	hit:11186_conv:22372_4_806
Thank you! I feel like a slob lately.	hit:11186_conv:22372_5_803
It's ok, just try your best to remind yourself how beautiful you are and practice self-care as a habit.	hit:11186_conv:22372_6_806
it is nice to have a loving pet , My dog is always there for me	hit:11187_conv:22374_1_675
What a great feeling! You must love your dog.	hit:11187_conv:22374_2_813
i really do, no matter what happens, she will always be by my side	hit:11187_conv:22374_3_675
She sounds like a great companion.	hit:11187_conv:22374_4_813
Hello! I started my graduate classes today.	hit:11189_conv:22378_1_803
Are you looking forward to it?	hit:11189_conv:22378_2_804
Yes. I have all my binders ready with paper and a calendar to keep track of stuff.  I'm nervous but ready!	hit:11189_conv:22378_3_803
Exciting! I'm sure you'll do fine.	hit:11189_conv:22378_4_804
I hope so!  It's very different from undergraduate	hit:11189_conv:22378_5_803
I really need to change doctors!	hit:11191_conv:22382_1_803
Why is that?	hit:11191_conv:22382_2_231
He keeps screwing up my prescription!  I've needed it for a week now but they keep sending it to the wrong place or use the wrong name	hit:11191_conv:22382_3_803
Wow, that's no good. I hope they get it worked out soon.	hit:11191_conv:22382_4_231
Me too.  	hit:11191_conv:22382_5_803
I was playing a VR game home alone.  It took a really creepy turn towards the end of the game.	hit:11193_conv:22387_1_318
I can't play those kinds of games. Too spooky for me.	hit:11193_conv:22387_2_231
It didnt start off scary but out of nowhere everyone around me was dying and I was home alone with a killer outside the house.  It all just feels so real in VR too.	hit:11193_conv:22387_3_318
That would keep me up at night.	hit:11193_conv:22387_4_231
yesterday i ate a whole big bag of M&Ms, i don't feel proud of myself	hit:11200_conv:22401_1_675
Oh my gosh that's insane. Well, I'm sure you'll be able to control your impulses in the future. 	hit:11200_conv:22401_2_817
i hope so, i was doing so well on my diet but I feel like I failed	hit:11200_conv:22401_3_675
I've been there before too. The important thing to remember is that there is always another chance to make it right tomorrow. 	hit:11200_conv:22401_4_817
We recently got a new puppy. My older dog waits his turn and knows the puppy should go outside to the bathroom first.	hit:11201_conv:22403_1_318
Aww, sounds like he is teaching the puppy. That's so sweet.	hit:11201_conv:22403_2_659
It is pretty awesome!  I'm impressed that he knows he doesnt need to be first and the puppy should have priority.	hit:11201_conv:22403_3_318
Yeah, sounds like a pretty smart pup.	hit:11201_conv:22403_4_659
We've been really struggling with potty training my son.	hit:11209_conv:22418_1_305
I do understand, I have a son myself. You just need to be patient and continue trying.	hit:11209_conv:22418_2_653
Thanks, we are.  He did finally go #2 in the toilet by himself last night, though!	hit:11209_conv:22418_3_305
That is awesome. I am proud of him 	hit:11209_conv:22418_4_653
I went out with some friends a couple weekends ago and we met a group of girls. One asked for my number but I told her I have a girlfriend and didnt give it out.	hit:11219_conv:22438_1_318
gotta risk it for the biscuit	hit:11219_conv:22438_2_818
Haha, I dont think I could do that to my girlfriend.  I like her too much for a random chick.	hit:11219_conv:22438_3_318
 i feel ya but sometimes temptation is good gets the heart pumping	hit:11219_conv:22438_4_818
i have a presentation due this week, I am not looking forward to presenting it in front of others	hit:11232_conv:22465_1_675
It can be nerve wrecking. I'm sure you will do fine, though! Have confidence!	hit:11232_conv:22465_2_684
i feel like i know the material but i am not sure if i can pull it off in front of others	hit:11232_conv:22465_3_675
You know they say, imagine them in their underwear...I wonder that really works. I'm not fond of public speaking either.	hit:11232_conv:22465_4_684
I felt very bad when my boss did not approve of my work. It just makes me more motivated to work harder.	hit:11233_conv:22466_1_725
Did you spend a lot of the time on the project?	hit:11233_conv:22466_2_318
Yes, I feel like I worked really hard and I put in so many hours. I guess it was not good enough. :(	hit:11233_conv:22466_3_725
I wouldnt get discouraged.  Maybe talk to your boss and see what you can improve on next time.  I'm sure, at least if you have a good boss, they will want you to succeed and guide you in how to do better.	hit:11233_conv:22466_4_318
Thank you for your great advice my friend!	hit:11233_conv:22466_5_725
My roommate moved out and soon my girlfriend will move in but right now it is just me in the house. I dont remember the last time I lived without any roommates.	hit:11233_conv:22467_1_318
Nice! Enjoy it! I like living alone. It is so peaceful! I get lonely somtimes but for the most part it is great!	hit:11233_conv:22467_2_725
It does feel a little lonely.  It's weird coming home and not really having someone to talk to in person.	hit:11233_conv:22467_3_318
Yeah, but they are all just a phone call away. Keep your head up, your girlfriend will be there soon!	hit:11233_conv:22467_4_725
I feel so happy when the sunsets are beautiful and I can take the time to watch and relax. It is the best time of the day for me.	hit:11235_conv:22470_1_725
Oh I know, mine too! I love how all the colors change with the setting sun.	hit:11235_conv:22470_2_820
Yeah, it is such a good time to reflect and meditate on life and stop to enjoy the beauty of this world.	hit:11235_conv:22470_3_725
It reminds you of how beautiful life is.	hit:11235_conv:22470_4_820
Man the new guys at work were slandering our boss so bad.	hit:11237_conv:22474_1_97
Wow, that's rude! He won't last long...	hit:11237_conv:22474_2_684
I know right?  I made sure to keep my mouth shut and not add on to what they were saying or doing.	hit:11237_conv:22474_3_97
Yeah, some nerve on that guy. He should be grateful to have a job!	hit:11237_conv:22474_4_684
My sister is having another baby! I can't wait to meet her! This will be her fourth child.	hit:11239_conv:22479_1_725
Oh wow! Congrats!! How exciting!! How far along is she?	hit:11239_conv:22479_2_820
Only one more month to go. She is about the explode though! Glad it is her and not me, lol.	hit:11239_conv:22479_3_725
LOL Right!!! It's way too hot to be pregnant right now!	hit:11239_conv:22479_4_820
Totally agree! But I will be there to fan my sister for her at least. Haha	hit:11239_conv:22479_5_725
You are so awesome!!! I wish I had  sister like you when I was pregnant.	hit:11239_conv:22479_6_820
There was a random dog in my yard yesterday morning.  He didn't look mean but I wasn't sure I wanted to mess with him.	hit:11240_conv:22481_1_97
I've been in that situation before!  It can be scary	hit:11240_conv:22481_2_527
It was!  I didn't want to chase him off either.  Thankfully he just kind of wandered away.	hit:11240_conv:22481_3_97
I'm glad it worked out in the end!  I wish people would be more careful with their dogs.	hit:11240_conv:22481_4_527
I bought something from the store and the lady gave me the wrong change. She gave me too much change actually. I did not realize until later after I left the store.	hit:11243_conv:22487_1_725
Oh, no. Did you take it back or keep it	hit:11243_conv:22487_2_102
I have not had time to go back yet but I will for sure. I feel bad like as if I did something wrong. I better check my change from now on.	hit:11243_conv:22487_3_725
The store might not take it back at this point if it has been to long. 	hit:11243_conv:22487_4_102
So I was driving down the road the other day and passed that stretch of road that has all those mimosa trees.  They were in bloom and man did they stir up some emotions.	hit:11244_conv:22488_1_97
That sounds beautiful! What emotions did they bring out of you?	hit:11244_conv:22488_2_816
My grandmother kept those trees at our old house.  They super made me miss her and when we used to sit outside on her porch.	hit:11244_conv:22488_3_97
I'm sorry! What a lovely memory to have of her though. It's good to still have things in your life that remind you of her.	hit:11244_conv:22488_4_816
So I lost the ring that my best friend gave me when he moved out of country.  We had matching ones made and it's really breaking my heart.	hit:11246_conv:22493_1_97
Oh no! That's so sad. I'm so sorry, I know you must feel like crap.	hit:11246_conv:22493_2_231
It's strange sometimes how we get so attached to material things like this.  I know I really shouldn't but it feels like a piece of me is gone.	hit:11246_conv:22493_3_97
I understand completely. I have things of my grandfather's that I can never replace.	hit:11246_conv:22493_4_231
We had a pretty fun family vacation about a month ago.	hit:11255_conv:22510_1_305
Sweet! Where did you go?	hit:11255_conv:22510_2_318
We went to a lake not far from here.  We had a ton of fun on the boat . . . nobody else was on the water one of the days!	hit:11255_conv:22510_3_305
That would be awesome to have the whole lake to yourself! My guess is the weather was nice too if you guys got to use the boat most days!	hit:11255_conv:22510_4_318
I work in tech support.  Every once in a while a customer will want our software to do something it either cant or is not built for.	hit:11255_conv:22511_1_318
I've had similar experiences.  What do you end up doing?	hit:11255_conv:22511_2_305
I write up feedback for development. It just gets frustrating when they start to demand that I fix it.  I might be good at my job but not good enough to do a code change on the fly.	hit:11255_conv:22511_3_318
Have you ever had a positive experience from that cycle?	hit:11255_conv:22511_4_305
I had to take my dog to the vet yesterday and I had full confidence they would take care of his problems. They are so good there.	hit:11261_conv:22523_1_475
oh no! hope all is well with your dog.	hit:11261_conv:22523_2_812
Thank you. Other than an allergic reaction and a subsequent skin infection all is well. Just a couple weeks of meds and a change in diet needed.	hit:11261_conv:22523_3_475
Good to read. Always great to find a vet you can trust. Looks like you did. 	hit:11261_conv:22523_4_812
So we went out to that new BBQ place to eat the other night.  	hit:11262_conv:22524_1_97
BBQ sounds so good right now! How was it?	hit:11262_conv:22524_2_816
It wasn't bad.  It wasn't earth shattering good either.  Everything just weirdly seemed okay.  It was a bit strange. 	hit:11262_conv:22524_3_97
Well that's kind of disappointing. It's always a let down when you go out and it isn't is good as you were hoping.	hit:11262_conv:22524_4_816
I really loathe meetings.  They're usually so pointless.	hit:11266_conv:22532_1_305
i completely agree. though, i'm remote so i am never sitting in the same room as others so i can distract myself ;)	hit:11266_conv:22532_2_812
That must be nice . . . I'm in person.  However, I actually had a productive meeting this morning.  How novel that was!	hit:11266_conv:22532_3_305
lol. it kinda is. i moved about 3 hours south of my office a few years ago and since even at the office my work involves connecting to remote data centers it hasn't changed my job any. 	hit:11266_conv:22532_4_812
Oh man.  I was at the store yesterday and my nose just started bleeding like crazy!	hit:11267_conv:22534_1_97
That's terrible! What did you do?	hit:11267_conv:22534_2_231
I had to bolt out of the store!  I have never been so embarrassed.  Lucky for me I had a napkin in my purse so I didn't get it everywhere.	hit:11267_conv:22534_3_97
That's good. I'm glad your alright.	hit:11267_conv:22534_4_231
Once in Kindergarten, a pair of my underwear got stuck in my shirt and fell out in the middle of the classroom.	hit:11268_conv:22537_1_513
Oh no! That's so sad. You must've been so upset. 	hit:11268_conv:22537_2_390
I was! I thought I was going to get in trouble	hit:11268_conv:22537_3_513
Hopefully you didn't and hopefully the other kids didn't make fun of you	hit:11268_conv:22537_4_390
the other day I was looking at old pictures of a car i use to own. I miss that car.	hit:11272_conv:22545_1_675
What kind of car was it?	hit:11272_conv:22545_2_809
i was an old Cadillac, reason I miss it, lot of memories of family and friends riding in it	hit:11272_conv:22545_3_675
Oh I bet! My husband wants an older car when we can afford it	hit:11272_conv:22545_4_809
i just lost my pet dog. I do not know what to do.	hit:11276_conv:22552_1_675
OH NO! I would be devastated. Did he pass, or missing?	hit:11276_conv:22552_2_423
i cannot find her anywhere, she is missing, it feels like I have a part of me missing 	hit:11276_conv:22552_3_675
I am so sorry. I am sure you are. I would be devastated if I was in your shoes. Does she have a chip? Maybe someone will get her to a vet office.	hit:11276_conv:22552_4_423
It was wonderful not having to worry about my most recent exam, knowing I was prepared.	hit:11278_conv:22556_1_513
Good job! How do you think you did on it?	hit:11278_conv:22556_2_423
I know I did well! I studied and felt very prepared when I took it.	hit:11278_conv:22556_3_513
That is a good feeling. Time to celebrate before the grind starts all over!	hit:11278_conv:22556_4_423
I packed for a long road trip, and had everything I would need to hopefully avoid excessive stops. 	hit:11280_conv:22560_1_513
Yeah I like going straight to the point too	hit:11280_conv:22560_2_224
Definitely. Nothing worse than dragging out a drive because you didn't pack enough food and didn't plan bathroom breaks.	hit:11280_conv:22560_3_513
I like when I get places earlier than expected	hit:11280_conv:22560_4_224
I had a dentist appointment yesterday.  I hate going to the dentist!	hit:11285_conv:22570_1_587
I understand that completely! Did you have to get any work done?	hit:11285_conv:22570_2_816
Yes I had to get a filling in my very back tooth.  THe dentist said I had a very deep cavity and to raise my hand if I started to feel anything because it was very close to my nerve.   I was scared the whole time.	hit:11285_conv:22570_3_587
That sounds scary! I always avoid going to the dentist until I absolutely have to. I know that's pretty bad!	hit:11285_conv:22570_4_816
My son wouldnt sleep last night.  He kept yelling and wouldnt go into his room.	hit:11302_conv:22605_1_318
Oh no! I hate when that happens. Was he afraid or just didn't want to sleep?	hit:11302_conv:22605_2_435
He just didnt want to sleep. I think he was overtired and trying to fight it at that point.	hit:11302_conv:22605_3_318
Ugh, that's the worst. That happens a lot with my son as well. Hopefully he wasn't too cranky today!	hit:11302_conv:22605_4_435
My son graduated pre-school.  It isnt much but its that next step in his school career.	hit:11307_conv:22614_1_318
That is wonderful! You must be happy, shows that he is getting bigger, soon it will be college 	hit:11307_conv:22614_2_653
Haha, I hope not too soon!  I was really happy, he is growing pretty fast!	hit:11307_conv:22614_3_318
College is when the tear will start to flow. I love children.	hit:11307_conv:22614_4_653
I'm going to a beer dabbler this weekend.  It has been very busy the last couple weeks so I'm really looking forward to drinking and relaxing this weekend.	hit:11315_conv:22631_1_318
That will be fun. What a great way to relax and unwind	hit:11315_conv:22631_2_820
I think so.  I'm hoping the weather will be nice and we can all have a great time!	hit:11315_conv:22631_3_318
I saw the weather forecast. We only have a 20% chance of rain so you know how it is here. We'll be good.	hit:11315_conv:22631_4_820
I'm trying to transition my dog into not sleeping in my room.  I know he wants to be by me and I can hear him whining and scratching at the door some nights	hit:11321_conv:22643_1_318
That must be hard to do, he wants to be beside you. He is going to miss you.	hit:11321_conv:22643_2_653
I know.  It's tough to hear but he needs to be a little more independent and sleep in his own bed too!	hit:11321_conv:22643_3_318
Yes he needs to so you would have to ignore him at nights.	hit:11321_conv:22643_4_653
i do love my pet doggy, she is a treat to have	hit:11325_conv:22651_1_675
That is so sweet. What is her name?	hit:11325_conv:22651_2_653
Angie, i like to give her a warm bath, dress her in her doggy clothes and give her a doggy treat	hit:11325_conv:22651_3_675
I can just imagine she sleeps in your bed sometimes. I love dogs, I would like to have a dog someday.	hit:11325_conv:22651_4_653
We just got a new puppy.  My older dog knew to let that one out first when I got home from work.	hit:11327_conv:22654_1_318
That is very cute, the little one probably couldn't hold its bladder as long. 	hit:11327_conv:22654_2_387
Definitely not.  I was surprised that he knew to let the little one go first!	hit:11327_conv:22654_3_318
That was very smart of him, maybe he remembers back to his puppy days.	hit:11327_conv:22654_4_387
I used to have my dog in his crate when I left for work.  Lately I have been letting him out more and more in the house when I've been gone.	hit:11331_conv:22663_1_318
That's good. How is it going?	hit:11331_conv:22663_2_762
It's going well!  So far no accidents and he doesnt appear to have ruined anything.	hit:11331_conv:22663_3_318
That's great news! It sounds like he is enjoying his new freedom, and was ready for it. 	hit:11331_conv:22663_4_762
I was driving down the road and I almost hit a dog! I was so close. Really scary!	hit:11336_conv:22672_1_725
I'm glad you didn't hit the dog!  Did he jump out at you suddenly?	hit:11336_conv:22672_2_90
Yes, he came out of nowhere and I slammed on my brakes. My tires skid across the road.	hit:11336_conv:22672_3_725
I live out in a rural area where people don't always have control of their dogs.  Sometimes those little ankle-biting dogs will start chasing the car and they make a break for the car and it makes one really fearful that you'll hit them.	hit:11336_conv:22672_4_90
I finished all the ice cream when I was told to leave some for others. I was just so hungry!	hit:11337_conv:22675_1_725
lol, guess you were pretty hungry	hit:11337_conv:22675_2_743
Yeah, now I am scared somebody will find out. I better go buy some more before anyone gets home. Haha	hit:11337_conv:22675_3_725
yeah, might wanna go replace it	hit:11337_conv:22675_4_743
I am the happiest in my life when I am at the ocean. There is just something so special about nature at the ocean for me.	hit:11340_conv:22681_1_725
That sounds amazing. What's your favorite beach to go to?	hit:11340_conv:22681_2_557
I don't really have a favorite. They are all my favorite! But I prefer the beaches that have perfect soft sand with no rocks or anything. Like a huge swimming pool! 	hit:11340_conv:22681_3_725
Those are the best. Especially the white sand crystal clear water beaches.	hit:11340_conv:22681_4_557
I saw Dubai from the airplane one day. I never went into the city, but wow, it was a sight to see!	hit:11343_conv:22687_1_725
i sure it was beautiful	hit:11343_conv:22687_2_743
It looked like another planet or something. Very sci-fi. Almost scary actually.	hit:11343_conv:22687_3_725
really, i wouldve never thought that. i have a friend who is in Dubai on a teaching assignment	hit:11343_conv:22687_4_743
I found out that my neighbors eat turtle meat. How gross!!!	hit:11345_conv:22691_1_725
yuck, how gross!!	hit:11345_conv:22691_2_743
Yeah, who does that? I have three pet turtles so I better keep a good watch on them. lol	hit:11345_conv:22691_3_725
lol right, they could easily be your neighbors dinner	hit:11345_conv:22691_4_743
I felt very sad recently when i found out that my mother has cancer 	hit:11346_conv:22693_1_12
Oh my gosh, I am so sorry for your family.	hit:11346_conv:22693_2_820
Thank you .  Shes a fighter i hope she can push through 	hit:11346_conv:22693_3_12
I'm sure she can with all the technology and modern medicine now. She's got this!!	hit:11346_conv:22693_4_820
I don't have many friends and my family lives very far away. I sometimes feel very sad.	hit:11348_conv:22697_1_725
why do you live so far from family	hit:11348_conv:22697_2_743
It is just where I ended up in life. You know one thing leads to another and your living a whole knew life.	hit:11348_conv:22697_3_725
i would like a new life. i totally understand	hit:11348_conv:22697_4_743
I heard a really loud bang in the middle of the night. the next morning I found out that it was gun shots. OMG	hit:11357_conv:22715_1_725
what? that scary	hit:11357_conv:22715_2_743
Someone was grabbed from their home and brought out to the street and was shot in the foot. Guess they wanted to teach him a lesson.	hit:11357_conv:22715_3_725
wow, a hard lesson	hit:11357_conv:22715_4_743
My internet connection keeps breaking! How am I going to get all my work done?	hit:11362_conv:22724_1_725
I understand!  I live in the country and have the same problem.	hit:11362_conv:22724_2_420
It always happens when there are electrical storms. It seems to be storm season around here.	hit:11362_conv:22724_3_725
Yes.  The only company available out here is Century Link and they just crash randomly all the time.	hit:11362_conv:22724_4_420
I feel very blessed that I have been able to live around the world my whole life. Now I am settled in one place for awhile.	hit:11364_conv:22729_1_725
That is very cool. What took you all around the world? What was your favourite place?	hit:11364_conv:22729_2_410
My father was in the military so I lived all over the world my first 20 years of life. My favorite place is Spain.	hit:11364_conv:22729_3_725
What interesting stories you must have! I think that would be really neat, but settling down is probably good too. 	hit:11364_conv:22729_4_410
My guinea pig had 5 babies but all of them died. I don't know why...	hit:11370_conv:22740_1_725
That is so sad.  I hate it when pets die.	hit:11370_conv:22740_2_420
Yeah, it is terrible. I just wish I knew why but oh well. She will have more babies in a couple months. 	hit:11370_conv:22740_3_725
yes.  they do like to have lots of  babies	hit:11370_conv:22740_4_420

I am not sure yet. I already have 4 dogs. I want to because he is so cute!	hit:11381_conv:22763_3_725
I don't know that I would be able to give it up.  4 is a lot, but what's one more?	hit:11381_conv:22763_4_458
Yeah, lol true!	hit:11381_conv:22763_5_725
My boyfriend is going out with a bunch of people I don't know tonight. But I trust him that he will be a good boy.	hit:11385_conv:22771_1_725
Well I'm sure he will be, most guys are. I'd never get to  do anything if my girlfriend didn't trust me.	hit:11385_conv:22771_2_814
Yeah. I was in a bad relationship before with a man that was extremely untrustworthy so sometimes I get a bit crazy sometimes. 	hit:11385_conv:22771_3_725
Everyone gets jealous, It when you act on unfounded stuff that is the issue.	hit:11385_conv:22771_4_814
I get so upset when someone does not agree with what I am doing. I am a grown women and feel I can make good choices for myself.	hit:11388_conv:22776_1_725
Yes sometimes people do stick their noses in where they do not belong	hit:11388_conv:22776_2_420
Yes, it is like they don't have a life of their own and want to control others lives. 	hit:11388_conv:22776_3_725
Yes.  Especially men who want to mansplain things to you.	hit:11388_conv:22776_4_420
By brother won a scratch off sticker lottery ticket! He is giving most of it to charity.	hit:11390_conv:22781_1_725
Wow!  How much did he win?	hit:11390_conv:22781_2_420
He won like $40,000. He is a good man to give it all away to a good cause.	hit:11390_conv:22781_3_725
That is awesome that he gave it away!  Maybe good karma will let him win again.	hit:11390_conv:22781_4_420
I was driving the other day and my gas tank was super low. I thought I could make it to school in time but decided that running out of gas was the bigger problem.	hit:11393_conv:22787_1_725
Good choice. You could have broken down and never made it to school.	hit:11393_conv:22787_2_748
Yeah so true. The funny thing is as I was driving into the gas station my car started to stall because of having zero gas. lol	hit:11393_conv:22787_3_725
HAHA! You are super lucky you are smart. Lol	hit:11393_conv:22787_4_748
Very often I get very emotional when things go wrong. I think more emotional than most people.	hit:11398_conv:22797_1_725
Everyone handles stress differently. My anxiety gets so High I sometimes cancel my plans.	hit:11398_conv:22797_2_814
I know it is not healthy for the body to get so stressed out but I just can't help it. Maybe I need a therapist.	hit:11398_conv:22797_3_725
I go to a psychiatrist and take meds, It just fixes what your body doesn't make, or do properly. It helps so much. 	hit:11398_conv:22797_4_814
I made a stupid mistake at work and I got fired. What am I going to do?	hit:11401_conv:22803_1_725
Oh no! It will be ok. It seems everyone in life has to go through that at least once. Everyone gets through it!	hit:11401_conv:22803_2_748
Yeah, I feel really bad though. It is such a terrible feeling to be rejected like that.	hit:11401_conv:22803_3_725
Sometimes you need those times to make your realize how special having a job is. Gives you perspective.	hit:11401_conv:22803_4_748
My son was very sick a few weeks ago, enough that he had to go to the hospital! I was nervous about what the doctor would have to say but had faith that he would help my son get better. 	hit:11418_conv:22836_1_791
I hope everything is fine, How did it turn out?	hit:11418_conv:22836_2_814
It turned out fine in the end. I knew the doctor would do what he thought was best - and my son did get better!	hit:11418_conv:22836_3_791
Im happy to hear that, a sick child is always a scary thing.	hit:11418_conv:22836_4_814

Sounds exciting. Have fun.	hit:11423_conv:22847_4_804
My friend just got a new car and it's the same car I've been wanting ever since it came out	hit:11431_conv:22863_1_475
Oh wow, are you feeling super envious?	hit:11431_conv:22863_2_816
You bet I am! I told him I was driving my car whenever we go out because I don't want to see it,lol.	hit:11431_conv:22863_3_475
Ha ha, I don't blame you! Hopefully you can get the car you want soon though.	hit:11431_conv:22863_4_816
My dog has been really sick this past week but after going to the vet I truly think he will be just fine	hit:11441_conv:22882_1_475
I 'm glad to here it will be fine , but what was wrong with it?	hit:11441_conv:22882_2_650
He want really weak and had a fever. It was because of an allergy that gave him a severe skin infection.	hit:11441_conv:22882_3_475
I 'm glad you was able to pin point the problem and I hope he stays in good health.	hit:11441_conv:22882_4_650
at work I kept on hearing people laughing behind me, when I got to my desk, my coworker pointed out a postage stamp was stuck on back of my head	hit:11459_conv:22918_1_675
Wow, that's so mean of them to laugh at you! At least someone pointed it out eventually, right? 	hit:11459_conv:22918_2_670
yeah, but i think my boss even seen it too, i wanted to hide under my desk	hit:11459_conv:22918_3_675
That's embarrasing. But hey, I think the best way to get over moments like those is to just laugh at yourself! Don't beat yourself up for it. 	hit:11459_conv:22918_4_670
My cousin has the perfect life, sometimes I am envious of her.	hit:11462_conv:22925_1_799
Wonderful I bet she is really content if everything is perfect. Love to hear that someone is doing well.	hit:11462_conv:22925_2_479
I do too, I just wish I had her life at times.	hit:11462_conv:22925_3_799
I understand but try not to be jealous. Good things will come to you to in its own time	hit:11462_conv:22925_4_479
i applied for a job promotion. But i won't know if i got it or not until next week	hit:11465_conv:22930_1_675
The waiting must be very difficult and nerve wracking.	hit:11465_conv:22930_2_831
i know, im having trouble concentrating at work, I just want to know right now	hit:11465_conv:22930_3_675
Things like that make me antsy.	hit:11465_conv:22930_4_831
After my haircut last week, I have received so many nice compliments!	hit:11474_conv:22949_1_799
A new haircut can do wonders! I always feel like a million bucks after.	hit:11474_conv:22949_2_816
I wasn't too sure about it but all the lovely compliments really made me feel good! 	hit:11474_conv:22949_3_799
I bet you looked great! Those compliments would've made me feel good too!	hit:11474_conv:22949_4_816
I was just reminiscing with my mother about my childhood.	hit:11489_conv:22979_1_799
Oh? What specifically were you talking to her about?	hit:11489_conv:22979_2_632
My aspirations when I was younger. We had a good laugh when I read in one of my old journals that I wanted to be a teacher when earlier that day I had stated that I couldn't imagine being a teacher now.	hit:11489_conv:22979_3_799
Haha! Well, as we mature, we learn so much more about ourselves.	hit:11489_conv:22979_4_632
I went to Six FLags once with my daughters.   I didnt want to go as I hate to ride roller coasters and am scared of heights.	hit:11491_conv:22983_1_587
Haha you are a good father. I hope you can make it through it!	hit:11491_conv:22983_2_748
I am a mother not a father silly.  Yes I made it through all right, but thought I was going to die!!   THey had me ride the ferris wheel and I was crying as they were laughing at me.	hit:11491_conv:22983_3_587
Oh my gosh! I'm sorry! haha Thats funny. Atleast you have them a story to always remember.;)	hit:11491_conv:22983_4_748
Today before work when I went to brush my teeth, there was no toothpaste left. My boyfriend used it all!	hit:11493_conv:22986_1_799
Oh no! So what did you do?!	hit:11493_conv:22986_2_670
I was so angry, I had to leave for work very soon. I ended up just asking a neighbor to borrow some. I didn't have anytime to buy any before work. I couldn't afford to be late.	hit:11493_conv:22986_3_799
That's nice of your neighbor! Your boyfriend should've told you that there was no toothpaste earlier. Maybe there would've been time to get some. But at least you didn't go to work with stinky breath, right?	hit:11493_conv:22986_4_670
I once had a party when I was a teenager.  My parents were out of town.	hit:11494_conv:22988_1_587
Haha everyone has to do that once. Can you tell me a great story about the party?	hit:11494_conv:22988_2_748
Sure can!   Of course you cant have a party as a teen without alcohol, so needless to say we were all drunk.   We attempted to play darts.   Since we were all drunk we missed the board leaving wholes all over the wall.  THe house was trashed when my parents returned.  Years later I feel bad about it still.	hit:11494_conv:22988_3_587
Hahaha thats funny. I hope you guys are still on good terms. To be honest little holes sounds like an easy fix.	hit:11494_conv:22988_4_748
i envy my sister, she is going on vacation in Paris	hit:11502_conv:23005_1_178
Wow, cool. Maybe you can ask to tag along?	hit:11502_conv:23005_2_766
I will be at work, maybe next time	hit:11502_conv:23005_3_178
That's too bad. Well, at least you have something to work towards and plan as a goal for yourself.	hit:11502_conv:23005_4_766
My litthe sister read out the speech in my graduation party	hit:11503_conv:23007_1_178
That's amazing! How old is she?	hit:11503_conv:23007_2_77
she is 9	hit:11503_conv:23007_3_178
Wow, that must've been a big thing for both of you.	hit:11503_conv:23007_4_77
I will be sitting for my nclex exam on friday	hit:11505_conv:23010_1_178
I am sorry I do not know what nclex is but I wish you good luck	hit:11505_conv:23010_2_838
Its a nursing exam, thank you	hit:11505_conv:23010_3_178
O ok I hope that everything works out for you 	hit:11505_conv:23010_4_838
One time there was a stray cat hiding from a dog in my front door	hit:11507_conv:23014_1_547
Wow! Did you try to get it out?	hit:11507_conv:23014_2_678
Yup, I adopted it and he's my pet now!	hit:11507_conv:23014_3_547
That's amazing! He probably loves you so much	hit:11507_conv:23014_4_678
i was upset at myself for sleeping in so late this morning	hit:11511_conv:23023_1_44
Do you feel nice and refreshed though?	hit:11511_conv:23023_2_291
yes definitely!	hit:11511_conv:23023_3_44
I did the same thing today, so you are not alone in your behavior friend!	hit:11511_conv:23023_4_291
I dropped my iPod touch on the bathroom floor.	hit:11512_conv:23025_1_580
Oh no! Did it break?	hit:11512_conv:23025_2_652
Unfortunately yes. The screen shattered and I went for over a month without music.	hit:11512_conv:23025_3_580
Oh, that really stinks. I hope you were able to get another one.	hit:11512_conv:23025_4_652
My guinea pig was feeling very sick but I was able to nurse her back to health.	hit:11513_conv:23026_1_725
Did you do some neat doctor stuff on it?	hit:11513_conv:23026_2_291
No, I hate giving chemical medicine to my animals. I just kept her on a heating blanket and gave her lots of fresh veggies. She is alright now!	hit:11513_conv:23026_3_725
Oh yea that sounds like you did a good job!	hit:11513_conv:23026_4_291
After training my dog I feel confident now that he can be around others dogs without fighting.	hit:11519_conv:23038_1_725
That is good, how long did it take before you go him to this point?	hit:11519_conv:23038_2_46
It took about a month. I think it was quicker but I was just too nervous to bring him around others dogs to find out.	hit:11519_conv:23038_3_725
Yeah i understand, it is good that you took him there though	hit:11519_conv:23038_4_46
my next door neighbor just bought a Mercedes, I wish i can have one.	hit:11522_conv:23044_1_675
Wow they must be doing well. Why dont you try to get one?	hit:11522_conv:23044_2_226
really cannot afford one, but the neighbor can, he is always buying expensive stuff, last month he bought a speed boat.	hit:11522_conv:23044_3_675
sounds wasteful to me. life isnt about material things anyway. 	hit:11522_conv:23044_4_226
Last week I had a argument with my son, he really said some mean things to me. I thought I raised him better.	hit:11524_conv:23048_1_799
Yeah sometimes kids say things that they really dont mean in the heat of the momment	hit:11524_conv:23048_2_46
It really hurt my feelings. I wish he would've handled it better. I'm more disappointed in him lashing out rather than what he said.	hit:11524_conv:23048_3_799
well maybe you guys should talk	hit:11524_conv:23048_4_46
I told him I was disappointed in his actions, but I still love him. We all make mistakes.	hit:11524_conv:23048_5_799
My roommate cooked some really foul smelling meat last night, I had to leave or I was going to puke.	hit:11528_conv:23057_1_799
Ugh my neighbors do that sometimes. It's the worst! I think some things should not be allowed to be cooked unless you live alone.	hit:11528_conv:23057_2_639
Exactly! I had to air out the place for a couple hours after.	hit:11528_conv:23057_3_799
Ick. Hopefully the smell is fully gone now	hit:11528_conv:23057_4_639
I used the restroom at a nice restaurant and I had toilet paper stuck to my shoe and didn't know it until I left. 	hit:11542_conv:23085_1_725
Oh that is the worst feeling! I hate using the restroom in public as is. 	hit:11542_conv:23085_2_639
Yeah, I wish someone told me at least. They all probably just laughed. Haha	hit:11542_conv:23085_3_725
Maybe.  For me I just don't want to cause a stranger to be embarassed lol	hit:11542_conv:23085_4_639
I am probably one of the few people in the world that looks forward to winter coming.	hit:11544_conv:23089_1_725
I am with you, i like it a lot more than summer personally	hit:11544_conv:23089_2_10
I can get so much work done indoor and the beauty outside is wonderful. I love winter clothes and all the winter holidays.	hit:11544_conv:23089_3_725
I feel that, I hate being hot. In the winter I can be comfy and I can always just put on a jacket if I get too cold, but in the summer it is not that easy.	hit:11544_conv:23089_4_10
When you took your driver's test were you nervous?	hit:11545_conv:23091_1_799
I was very nervous. I did not know if I would pass or not.	hit:11545_conv:23091_2_842
I took mine last summer I was nervous also. My heat was racing the whole time. I was so anxious!	hit:11545_conv:23091_3_799
Did you pass the test?	hit:11545_conv:23091_4_842
Sometimes I feel envious of those that have money than I do.	hit:11548_conv:23096_1_725
I am the same way, I barely make anything compared to a lot of people I know	hit:11548_conv:23096_2_10
Yeah, and it seems so hard to make money these days, at least for me. Maybe I should move to the city where there are more opportunities.	hit:11548_conv:23096_3_725
I think cities are more expensive, like living costs, so I do not want to live there ether personally	hit:11548_conv:23096_4_10
Yeah, you are right my friend. :)	hit:11548_conv:23096_5_725
i believed my friend would return my cell phone to me in time	hit:11554_conv:23109_1_44
I'm assuming that he/she didn't return it in time. I'm sorry.	hit:11554_conv:23109_2_536
i accidentally left it at his house and had to message him on facebook and ask him if he could drive it over	hit:11554_conv:23109_3_44
Oh, I understand. Did it bring it to you at all?	hit:11554_conv:23109_4_536
I am as sure as the sun will rise tomorrow that I will get this job promotion!	hit:11555_conv:23110_1_725
That is amazing!  I'm really happy for you!	hit:11555_conv:23110_2_527
Thank you! I have worked so hard for so many years and finally it shows that someone paid attention. :)	hit:11555_conv:23110_3_725
It sounds like you really deserve it!	hit:11555_conv:23110_4_527
Last week I almost got into a car accident, I was terrified. 	hit:11564_conv:23128_1_799
that does sound terrifying , are you feeling better ?	hit:11564_conv:23128_2_321
I am but I still think about how things could've been so much different right now if I hadn't swerved just at the right moment.	hit:11564_conv:23128_3_799
at least your ok, thank god for that	hit:11564_conv:23128_4_321
there is an upcoming promotion at my job, I am sure i'm going to get it.	hit:11565_conv:23131_1_675
Nice, for what position	hit:11565_conv:23131_2_119
as a supervisor. I feel that all of my hard work and skill has given me the inside track for this position	hit:11565_conv:23131_3_675
That's pretty great, you must really take the initiative.  Good job	hit:11565_conv:23131_4_119
I have all my ingredients for my dinner party and now I am getting ready to prepare a feast!	hit:11566_conv:23132_1_725
You're much braver than me. I would never host a dinner party.. don't feel like I'm good at planning, and don't feel like I'm interesting enough to talk to a bunch of different people.	hit:11566_conv:23132_2_273
Yeah, we all have different personalities. But you would come to a dinner party if invited, right?	hit:11566_conv:23132_3_725
"I think, maybe, yeah! It depends on who's there, and if I felt comfortable with the host. If I felt like I had enough people to kind of ""rescue me"" and who I could talk to at the party if I got anxious and couldn't talk to strangers, then that'd be alright. Other than that, I just kind of do like maybe a group of 4, max"	hit:11566_conv:23132_4_273
I broke one of my mom's crystal figurine, I tried hard not to tell her but in the end I felt so bad I had to tell her.	hit:11573_conv:23147_1_799
Aw, that's too bad. You did the right thing by telling her though.	hit:11573_conv:23147_2_652
Yes, she didn't even get mad. I still felt so guilty about it though. 	hit:11573_conv:23147_3_799
Maybe you could save up and purchase her a new one.	hit:11573_conv:23147_4_652
Honestly that is such a wonderful idea!	hit:11573_conv:23147_5_799
I feel happy to know that God has got my back and I don't have to worry about anything.	hit:11574_conv:23149_1_725
I am right there with you!  God is good and wow, He's been with me through so much hardship.  I'm so happy you feel the same way.	hit:11574_conv:23149_2_438
Oh yes. He is there within all of us and he is the greatest friend we will ever have! He will never let us down. Even when we think He has we should only think it is something that I need to learn and He is so caring that He wants to teach me.	hit:11574_conv:23149_3_725
Yes, we can always count on Him to know the bigger picture and have faith that He's working for our good.  Hope you have a blessed day!	hit:11574_conv:23149_4_438
I miss how we all used to celebrate Christmas when I was a child. It was such a warm and cozy time. Things are really changing in this high tech modern world.	hit:11578_conv:23156_1_725
They really have changed. I know exactly how you feel and love thinking back to the time.	hit:11578_conv:23156_2_49
Yeah, so you remember all those wonderful old Christmas movies and all those commercials they played in between. I still have some videos of recordings from the 80's. 	hit:11578_conv:23156_3_725
Those were awesome! My favorite was the coke commercial at Christmas time. So many memories!	hit:11578_conv:23156_4_49
In July, I found a large moth inside a cottage that my brother and friends were staying at.	hit:11580_conv:23161_1_580
Oh fun!  How big was it about?  Did it have neat markings on it?	hit:11580_conv:23161_2_438
It was as big as a small bird, I was super surprised. It was furry and white all over. I caught it with a cup and let it outside so it can live on!	hit:11580_conv:23161_3_580
I think I saw someone post a picture of those online. Maybe it was a lunar moth! What a fun experience!	hit:11580_conv:23161_4_438
My sister gave birth to a beautiful healthy baby girl last week! I was so happy to meet my niece.	hit:11581_conv:23163_1_799
What is your nieces name?	hit:11581_conv:23163_2_375
Amelia, she makes my heart so happy!	hit:11581_conv:23163_3_799
That's amazing, was it your sisters first baby?	hit:11581_conv:23163_4_375
I planted a whole bunch of flower bushes this year. I cannot wait until next spring when my entire garden will be in bloom with so many wonderful colors and smells.	hit:11584_conv:23169_1_725
It will be amazing!  I should do that too!	hit:11584_conv:23169_2_203
Yes! I just went to the local nursery and they had so many plants to choose from. I made sure to only choose the ones that had some kind of fragrant smell. I am dreaming of all the flower arrangements I will make next year.	hit:11584_conv:23169_3_725
That sounds so great!   I hope your plants grow beautifully!	hit:11584_conv:23169_4_203
Thanks!! :)	hit:11584_conv:23169_5_725
After feeling depressed for days, I took the time to sit outside in the sun and have a nice chit chat with my mom.	hit:11588_conv:23176_1_580
That sounds like the perfect remedy for feeling down. Getting out in the sun and outside the house/bed is so good.  I'm sorry you're struggling with depression.  I understand.	hit:11588_conv:23176_2_438
Thank you for your kind words, it means a lot really. And yeah the cool breeze felt so comforting, it completely changed my mood!	hit:11588_conv:23176_3_580
I am so glad!  You know what to do to help your body and mind and that is good self-care.  I try to do that as well as meditate and pray in the morning.  Really refocuses me.  I'm glad you're feeling better!	hit:11588_conv:23176_4_438
There may be a hurricane in my area soon I am kind of scared.	hit:11592_conv:23185_1_799
I imagine, are you prepared for it?	hit:11592_conv:23185_2_203
Not yet, but I will start preparing. I am worried we may lose power or our house may flood.	hit:11592_conv:23185_3_799
Oh yes, last year with huracan Irma we went without power for 5 days.	hit:11592_conv:23185_4_203
i felt nostalgiac going through old childhood belongings	hit:11595_conv:23191_1_44
Aw, did it bring back a lot of good memories for you?	hit:11595_conv:23191_2_438
yes definitely, it was great	hit:11595_conv:23191_3_44
That's awesome. Sometimes I wish I could be back in my childhood. Maybe if only for a day. ha ha.	hit:11595_conv:23191_4_438
i forgot to pay my credit card bill, I'm so disappointed with myself.	hit:11598_conv:23197_1_327
I am sure it'll be ok. Usually if you stay in contact with them and don't blow them off for a long time it will be OK.	hit:11598_conv:23197_2_748
Yeah but i am usually so meticulous about those things.  I hope they don't charge an overdraft fee.	hit:11598_conv:23197_3_327
I would call them. They usually give you some credit for that.	hit:11598_conv:23197_4_748
i have a presentation tomorrow. I am ready for it.	hit:11610_conv:23220_1_675
That's good. I assume you have studied hard and are prepared?	hit:11610_conv:23220_2_243
for the past two weeks I have bee working on it and this week I have been practicing it 	hit:11610_conv:23220_3_675
Good luck! You will do great!	hit:11610_conv:23220_4_243
I once called my girlfriend's mother mom by accident.	hit:11617_conv:23235_1_580
Haha, I'm sorry but I had a little laugh at that. It reminded me of the time I did that to my teacher in school. I was embarrassed, but it made me feel better to find out that it seems like it's a common thing that happens, since they're female authority figures that you can easily mix up.	hit:11617_conv:23235_2_273
Exactly, especially since we were only dating for a few months! I felt so awkward but she just laughed it off.	hit:11617_conv:23235_3_580
Yeah, she knew what you meant. She probably forgot in two minutes, while you've thought about it for much longer. The best thing to do there is to just show off your sense of humor and ability to make fun of yourself and not take yourself too seriously, which it sounds like maybe you did.	hit:11617_conv:23235_4_273
The pigeons keep coming into the house a pooping all over the place!	hit:11624_conv:23249_1_725
That's gross, why are they coming in?	hit:11624_conv:23249_2_375
Well they are actually my pet pigeons. They are the beautiful white ones with a fan tail. But they sometimes like to come inside to see if they can munch on anything.	hit:11624_conv:23249_3_725
You should probably avoid feeding them if you want a clean house.	hit:11624_conv:23249_4_375
No better I just put some screen on my windows, lol.	hit:11624_conv:23249_5_725
Oh, I am so sad that my family could not come and visit me. I miss them all so much. Why is life so busy for everyone these days?	hit:11627_conv:23255_1_725
I sure wish it wasn't. I live far from my family and they can't even make time for me to go to them. So I feel for you, it is very sad.	hit:11627_conv:23255_2_639
Family should come first, right? The people of today are just becoming more isolated and lonely. I wish everyone would wake up!	hit:11627_conv:23255_3_725
Absolutely first. Especially when you don't live close.	hit:11627_conv:23255_4_639
Recently I had a very good customer service experience with my cable company. Not only did they fix the problem they gifted me free premium content for a year!	hit:11630_conv:23261_1_799
I bet it wasn't Comcast! They wouldn't even give you a cup of water for free.	hit:11630_conv:23261_2_59
That's so funny! I was so surprised too but really happy. I might even pay for the services when my free year is up.	hit:11630_conv:23261_3_799
I am glad you had a nice experience! Its difficult to find such a company that cares about its customers!	hit:11630_conv:23261_4_59
My dog eats other animals poop. I have seen them eat goat, duck and cow poop. I hope they don't get sick.	hit:11632_conv:23265_1_725
Oh, wow! That is crazy, have you talked to the vet?	hit:11632_conv:23265_2_123
The vet says that this can be normal but to make sure that I give them their worm pills regularly. 	hit:11632_conv:23265_3_725
I thought it would be normal. Good thing to be cautious. 	hit:11632_conv:23265_4_123
Last night there was a terrible thunderstorm. I unplugged all my computers and electronics. Then there was a loud bang and I heard my electrical box make a loud click. I think my house was electrocuted!	hit:11635_conv:23270_1_725
Well it is a good thing you unplugged everything!	hit:11635_conv:23270_2_10
Yeah! I learned my lesson from experience. We get pretty crazy storms out here. 	hit:11635_conv:23270_3_725
That is a good lesson to learn early, I am glad everything turned out okay for you!	hit:11635_conv:23270_4_10
I cannot wait until the weekend is here! I'm going skydiving for the first time!	hit:11641_conv:23283_1_725
That sounds amazing!  But terrifying too lol	hit:11641_conv:23283_2_527
I am not nervous yet but I for sure will be when it's time to jump out of that plane! Oh, what am I getting myself into, lol.	hit:11641_conv:23283_3_725
I admire you!  I don't think you'll regret getting this experience	hit:11641_conv:23283_4_527
When I was a kid I used to steal candy from the local 7/11 with my brother. We never got caught from the store but my parents found all the wrappers hiding in our room.	hit:11652_conv:23304_1_725
Hahah that is funny. Were your parents angry?	hit:11652_conv:23304_2_748
Yes, they demanded to know where we got the money to buy all that candy. We lied and said it was from a birthday party at school. Haha	hit:11652_conv:23304_3_725
Haha did they believe it?	hit:11652_conv:23304_4_748
Yes, heehee......	hit:11652_conv:23304_5_725
A friend borrowed some video games of mine	hit:11653_conv:23307_1_111
nice, what system do you play on?	hit:11653_conv:23307_2_524
Xbox primarily, I'm hoping he'll get everything back in one piece	hit:11653_conv:23307_3_111
i really enjoy video games as well	hit:11653_conv:23307_4_524
I cannot stand my neighbor's dog's barking, its never ending	hit:11655_conv:23311_1_675
That's the worst! Have you tried talking to your neighbor?	hit:11655_conv:23311_2_655
i have, that what makes me so mad, he just smiles at me while I tell him and he does not do anything about it	hit:11655_conv:23311_3_675
You might try contacting the authorities, though I don't know if it would help. 	hit:11655_conv:23311_4_655
I found some of my old toys that I had passed down to my younger brother today while cleaning up his closet.	hit:11663_conv:23326_1_580
thats awesome! its really cool to be able to keep things in the family	hit:11663_conv:23326_2_524
It really was! It brought back so many wonderful and touching memories.	hit:11663_conv:23326_3_580
did he enjoy the toys>	hit:11663_conv:23326_4_524
He really did. It made me happy.	hit:11663_conv:23326_5_580
The first time my girlfriend invited me to her father's house, I was super anxious.	hit:11666_conv:23332_1_580
Yeah that can be nerve racking! How did it go?	hit:11666_conv:23332_2_123
He mostly speaks French, and although I understand it perfectly I have trouble speaking. In the end it went well, and he was super easy-going and made me feel like family.	hit:11666_conv:23332_3_580
That is good! Are you guys close now>	hit:11666_conv:23332_4_123
We are! Every time I come over, we drink a lot of different beers together. It's how we bond!	hit:11666_conv:23332_5_580
I spent hours reviewing notes and course content to prepare myself for a few trials that a company wanted me to go through.	hit:11669_conv:23338_1_580
Good job! Do you feel pretty prepared?	hit:11669_conv:23338_2_748
I felt super prepared and I ended up getting the job just last Thursday!	hit:11669_conv:23338_3_580
WOWZA! Congrats! Is it a job you can build a career out of.	hit:11669_conv:23338_4_748
In a way yes and no. I'm teaching online, and my major in University is Education at the moment. So it helps me in school, and looks good on a CV for a full-time teacher position in an actual school someday in the future.	hit:11669_conv:23338_5_580
Oh thats good! Thanks for teaching. :)	hit:11669_conv:23338_6_748
Thank you for appreciating teachers!	hit:11669_conv:23338_7_580
My mom is one so i know how important you guys are.	hit:11669_conv:23338_8_748
My friend is so lucky, he always seems to be winning lotteries and gambles of sorts.	hit:11671_conv:23342_1_580
Man.. i need some of that luck!	hit:11671_conv:23342_2_524
Same here. Just last week, he won over $400 playing slot machines, and I really wish that could've been me.	hit:11671_conv:23342_3_580
Wow thats awesome! i never win anything like that	hit:11671_conv:23342_4_524
I really appreciate an artists talents. It is pretty incredible what beauty they can create!	hit:11685_conv:23371_1_725
I agree! I wish I was able to make things	hit:11685_conv:23371_2_123
It is really fun to create things, anyone can do it! But talent I think is a gift from God.	hit:11685_conv:23371_3_725
For sure you are born with those types of talents!	hit:11685_conv:23371_4_123
i was channel surfing and ran across the old Batman tv show, brought back memories.	hit:11689_conv:23378_1_675
That is cool! I love flash backs from the past especially when it comes to television. I sometimes watch old shows on youtube that I used to watch as a kid. Love it!	hit:11689_conv:23378_2_725
same here, I loved watching Batman as a kid and could not wait to get home from school to watch it.	hit:11689_conv:23378_3_675
I used to watch the Wonder Years after school. I love watching it until this very day. 	hit:11689_conv:23378_4_725
When I was a little girl I would have to wear shoes with holes in it to school. Everyone made fun of me all the time. My family could not afford much.	hit:11689_conv:23379_1_725
that must have been embarrassing, I hope you weren't to traumatized	hit:11689_conv:23379_2_675
I think it is a good trauma cause to this day it keeps me working hard for my dreams so that I will never have to be in that place again.	hit:11689_conv:23379_3_725
that is good to hear, it was a motivation to succeed, a great character building 	hit:11689_conv:23379_4_675
i was sad to see my favorite tree had been broken in the storm last week	hit:11694_conv:23388_1_44
Aw man that sucks. It must have been a crazy storm.	hit:11694_conv:23388_2_748
it was pretty bad but i think the tree was already dying	hit:11694_conv:23388_3_44
How big was it?	hit:11694_conv:23388_4_748
I am very fearful of dying. I know it will come one day, I just hope and pray it doesn't hurt so bad.	hit:11703_conv:23407_1_725
You shouldn't think about death whilst you're alive! Just live each day to the fullest. 	hit:11703_conv:23407_2_59
Yes you are right but it is hard to not think about it when there is so much death going on around the world and we have to hear about it through the media.	hit:11703_conv:23407_3_725
Yes but death comes to all of us someday. So I think its best we enjoy our life whilst we are blessed with it. 	hit:11703_conv:23407_4_59
You are right my friend! Thanks!	hit:11703_conv:23407_5_725
Last week I really had to rely on my friend to keep his word.	hit:11714_conv:23429_1_340
That is a good test of friendship.  Did he keep his word?	hit:11714_conv:23429_2_485
Yes in the end, he showed up and help me fix my car. I am really glad that he did.	hit:11714_conv:23429_3_340
It is such a blessing to have good friends on whom you can depend.  	hit:11714_conv:23429_4_485
next week I find out if i got the promotion at my job. I have my fingers crossed.	hit:11716_conv:23432_1_675
Nice! I hope you get it, I'll cross my fingers for you also! Do you think you got a good chance?	hit:11716_conv:23432_2_448
i do not know, i feel like i have done all I can to get it, but you never know	hit:11716_conv:23432_3_675
That's all you can do, but if you worked hard, I'm sure you will get it!	hit:11716_conv:23432_4_448
Last month cleaning out the attic I found a old box of photo albums that had belonged to my mother.	hit:11719_conv:23439_1_340
Oh cool. Were there any good picture in there?	hit:11719_conv:23439_2_138
So many good pictures. It was great reliving all of those old memories, many I had forgotten about.	hit:11719_conv:23439_3_340
Well that's nice. I am glad they were happy memories for you. 	hit:11719_conv:23439_4_138
I just got a new haircut, lets say this, I do not like it.	hit:11722_conv:23444_1_675
Oh boy.  I've gotten quite a few of those before.  New hairstylist?	hit:11722_conv:23444_2_294
no, same style from my barber who always cuts my hair, for some reason he did a terrible job	hit:11722_conv:23444_3_675
That's odd.  I would've told him so and asked for my money back. 	hit:11722_conv:23444_4_294
yesterday, i was drinking a glass of milk. When i put the glass back down, a fly was swimming in the milk	hit:11736_conv:23473_1_675
Ohhhh, disgusting.  What did you do?	hit:11736_conv:23473_2_294
first i did not know what it was, than i realized it was a fly, i was about to throw up	hit:11736_conv:23473_3_675
I bet, what a terrible feeling!	hit:11736_conv:23473_4_294
i know, flies are filthy creatures  and plus they produce maggots, yuck	hit:11736_conv:23473_5_675
Oh man, your making it even worse.  I never even thought about that.  Now I want to throw up.	hit:11736_conv:23473_6_294

i have to give a presentation on Monday, I don't think I'm ready	hit:11750_conv:23500_1_675
is there anything that you can do to help prepare yourself?	hit:11750_conv:23500_2_514
i think i'm ready but it is the waiting  to give it , I just want it to be over	hit:11750_conv:23500_3_675
yeah i can understand that!! id want to get it over with too. the sooner the better	hit:11750_conv:23500_4_514
A few of my co-workers said they'd be absent next week	hit:11757_conv:23515_1_111
Oh my, I hope that doesn't mean more workload for you.	hit:11757_conv:23515_2_59
Yeah, I hope we don't get a ton of work while they're gone	hit:11757_conv:23515_3_111
Maybe you should ask for overtime pay just in case you do get more work!	hit:11757_conv:23515_4_59
I have to take a plane trip next week, I'm not looking forward to it and I have to take a plane trip next week, I'm not looking forward to it.	hit:11761_conv:23522_1_675
Yeah, flying can be scary.	hit:11761_conv:23522_2_322
i know, just the idea of being in a plane up in the sky, scares the bejesus out of me	hit:11761_conv:23522_3_675
Hopefully it isn't a long flight.	hit:11761_conv:23522_4_322
I left my young daughter with my friend. I totally trust her though, she will be a great mom someday!	hit:11762_conv:23524_1_327
thats awesome that you trust her	hit:11762_conv:23524_2_514
yeah she is a great person.  she is a little younger than me.	hit:11762_conv:23524_3_327
its hard to find good people you can trust with your kids nowadays	hit:11762_conv:23524_4_514
One time my cat got ran over by a car	hit:11792_conv:23584_1_547
Oh no! Thats horrible. Were you driving?	hit:11792_conv:23584_2_748
No, it was some person driving recklessly!	hit:11792_conv:23584_3_547
Oh Gosh that is horrible. I am so sorry that happened to you.	hit:11792_conv:23584_4_748
Last year during the spring, our area got record rainfall. My basement ended up getting flooded and destroying many of my childhood things and keepsakes.	hit:11795_conv:23590_1_340
That's the worst! Because now you'll be freaking out trying to think of the things you may not even remember whether or not could have been there. That must be an anxious feeling. 	hit:11795_conv:23590_2_273
It really is, it just sucks losing all of those things. They were like my connection to the past.	hit:11795_conv:23590_3_340
Yeah, I'm not quite a hoarder or a packrat when it comes to those things, but I do get sentimental with some physical objects. If I lost them, I'd feel like it would be an itch I couldn't scratch, because I couldn't replace what I lost. Hopefully you can work past it somehow.	hit:11795_conv:23590_4_273
I am at peace with myself after taking a nice hot shower	hit:11810_conv:23620_1_547
Oh man, thats the best feeling in the world. Getting out of a shower especially if its into clean freshly laundered sheets.	hit:11810_conv:23620_2_138
Yes! I feel like a new person!	hit:11810_conv:23620_3_547
It's such a wonderful feeling, I should take a shower soon too.	hit:11810_conv:23620_4_138
what kind of saturday is this, i mean sure it's a relaxing one but damn i really blew it on the budget plan	hit:11826_conv:23653_1_568
How did you you go over your budget?	hit:11826_conv:23653_2_322
i spend it like maniac i am so disappointed in myself...	hit:11826_conv:23653_3_568
I hope you can have better self-control in the future.	hit:11826_conv:23653_4_322
I Really really can't wait! next week is the week! i finally get to see my love 	hit:11828_conv:23657_1_568

i am just absolutely mind boggled, i just brought the coffee 3 days ago! and it's ALREADY FINISHED! WHAT 	hit:11832_conv:23664_1_568
Oh gosg. Do you have some greedy roommates or something?	hit:11832_conv:23664_2_748
just greedy? more than that, who the hell finishes a whole 500g of coffee in 3 days !	hit:11832_conv:23664_3_568
Hahahaa good point. Maybe try hiding your groceries.	hit:11832_conv:23664_4_748
have you ever had that one person who never ever disappoints you?	hit:11834_conv:23668_1_568
yea i have	hit:11834_conv:23668_2_63
me too, she's recently going through a lot and despite all that, she's working hard everyday for us and i am just so happy and lucky to have her	hit:11834_conv:23668_3_568
thats great, happy for yo	hit:11834_conv:23668_4_63
ever just feel so isolated in a room and alone? what a weird day	hit:11836_conv:23672_1_568
literally me right now actually	hit:11836_conv:23672_2_63
same, it's just such a slow day too, but one thing that is making me hopeful is tht next week i am going to travel to see fiance	hit:11836_conv:23672_3_568
must be nice to have someone that loves you	hit:11836_conv:23672_4_63
...i am truly utterly worthless, i couldn't even submit my work on time	hit:11839_conv:23679_1_568
What is going on with your work?	hit:11839_conv:23679_2_375
i had an assignment to submit but i didn't submit it on time, i am so disappointed in myself 	hit:11839_conv:23679_3_568
You can do better next time I believe in you!	hit:11839_conv:23679_4_375
i am so looking forward to the day we pass from this world and go to heaven	hit:11841_conv:23683_1_568
Ouch.  Why? 	hit:11841_conv:23683_2_389
because  i am a very faithful person and i trust in my god!	hit:11841_conv:23683_3_568
Oh I see.  Very interesting that your faith makes you want to die though.	hit:11841_conv:23683_4_389
tomorrow is my first university day and i'm very nervous	hit:11842_conv:23685_1_717
its not so bad, it can be intimidating but you just need to figure out the campus layout and classes but its very smooth from there	hit:11842_conv:23685_2_63
i hope i won't get lost but i'm so bad with that, i always get lost. 	hit:11842_conv:23685_3_717
once you figure the way it just becomes routine	hit:11842_conv:23685_4_63
whenever you feel so hopeless, so distance and you feel like nothing ever matters, just remember to trust in the universe, for it has a plan for you	hit:11843_conv:23687_1_568
You are so right, did you read that somewhere?	hit:11843_conv:23687_2_375
no, i just came up with this philosophy while facing an existential dilemma 	hit:11843_conv:23687_3_568
That is cool, have you studied any philosophy in school?	hit:11843_conv:23687_4_375
No, i study it in my free time	hit:11843_conv:23687_5_568
do you ever just feel so grateful that you're alive?	hit:11844_conv:23688_1_717
Yes, I feel that every day.	hit:11844_conv:23688_2_322
it's the most amazing feeling ever right? it feels like the universe gives us everything.	hit:11844_conv:23688_3_717
I wish people understood how precious life really is.	hit:11844_conv:23688_4_322
i threw my laptop the other day and i already regret it	hit:11846_conv:23693_1_717
Why did you throw your laptop?	hit:11846_conv:23693_2_322
because i was very pissed off, i wasn't able to work .	hit:11846_conv:23693_3_717
Sometimes I lose my temper like that too.	hit:11846_conv:23693_4_322
3-3, final game decides it all, final game till promotion, time ticking, palms sweating, final minute and just as we are about to win it all, to finally reach that noble masters rank, my team mate fails to make the correct decision and we lose, it all just crumbles to the ground like rocks falling from the sky, my dream gone 	hit:11847_conv:23695_1_568
wow thats vivid, what game was this?	hit:11847_conv:23695_2_63
league of legends, my other addiction, other than my fiance 	hit:11847_conv:23695_3_568
ah yes league, love hate relationship with that game but after 4 years it can really still tilt me more and more	hit:11847_conv:23695_4_63
i was super late for my meeting on tuesday , i got so embarrassed 	hit:11848_conv:23697_1_717
Oh no, I hope it wasn't an important meeting.	hit:11848_conv:23697_2_633
it was actually, and because of the traffic i couldn't make it	hit:11848_conv:23697_3_717
Sorry to hear that, were they understanding about it?	hit:11848_conv:23697_4_633
my wife has been very sick recently and i am making the soup that is famous with our family recipe and she is slowly getting better	hit:11849_conv:23699_1_568
I'm sorry your wife is sick.  What kind of soup is it?	hit:11849_conv:23699_2_322
it's called lentil soup and we make it a special way with cumin spice and love 	hit:11849_conv:23699_3_568
That sounds quite delicious if I must say.	hit:11849_conv:23699_4_322
ever feel so full of emotions when looking at old pictures?	hit:11851_conv:23703_1_568
Yeah.  reminds me of the good old days!  	hit:11851_conv:23703_2_389
for me it's when you get more than just nostalgia, when you get sad, happy and sentimental 	hit:11851_conv:23703_3_568
Yeah same here.  I remember one time awhile back I took some pictures of when the aliens landed in my backyard.   That was some good times!	hit:11851_conv:23703_4_389
i am just so scared of what is going to happen in the future, i need to make money, have a house, own a car, and other materialistic good because  i am a person of the 21st century and i cannot afford any of this so i need to get a job, but all these jobs are paying me next to nothing despite my masters degree in computer science, what to do?	hit:11852_conv:23705_1_568
Yikes, that's a tough one and I can definitely feel your pain on the job market. I think either network your way to a higher pay job (depends on connections) or possibly go back to school to a doctorate or certain specialist degrees.	hit:11852_conv:23705_2_332
ummm? excuse me? do you know people earn a lot from computer science, it is not my degree for sure, it's this corrupt world we live in that's the problem	hit:11852_conv:23705_3_568
Yes but the market is quite flooded with CS degree holders. It's hard to get something unless you are specialized I think. Unfortunately I don't see society changing any time soon.	hit:11852_conv:23705_4_332
life is beautiful isn't it?	hit:11853_conv:23706_1_568
Life is the most beautiful thing.	hit:11853_conv:23706_2_322
are you happy with the way things are? i am enjoying every second	hit:11853_conv:23706_3_568
I live every day like it's my last.	hit:11853_conv:23706_4_322
i hate when that happens, i was suppose to be the on who was first, who was suppose to go first in the line, but instead my friend ended up going first	hit:11855_conv:23710_1_568
Waiting in line is the worst.	hit:11855_conv:23710_2_322
but it was in the line for university classes, i am so jealous 	hit:11855_conv:23710_3_568
I hope you got your classes.	hit:11855_conv:23710_4_322
i feel like there is nothing that i can't do, i feel so powerful!  and smart! i just implemented a kmeans algorithm with my own method  	hit:11857_conv:23714_1_568
Sounds like you are pretty confident in yourself!	hit:11857_conv:23714_2_332
yup i am !  so so confident and i think this is a good trait to have	hit:11857_conv:23714_3_568
I agree that it is as well. In most situations, it can work to one's benefit.	hit:11857_conv:23714_4_332
feelsbadman, some one in this absurd family ! WHO KEEPS ON TAKING MY BLOODY SHOES! 	hit:11858_conv:23717_1_568
I don't understand what you are trying to tell me. Is this a joke?	hit:11858_conv:23717_2_548
no, i am angry! imagine every morning you wake and someone in your family takes your shoes because they want to make you angry	hit:11858_conv:23717_3_568
Why would they want to do that?	hit:11858_conv:23717_4_548
like i said to  make me angry, they are selfish and jealous	hit:11858_conv:23717_5_568
it sure does bring back a lot of fond memories as you go for a walk past your old neighbourhood 	hit:11859_conv:23718_1_568
I can imagine the flood of emotions.	hit:11859_conv:23718_2_322
yup, many memories from the past, the good, the bad	hit:11859_conv:23718_3_568
I hope it was worth visiting.	hit:11859_conv:23718_4_322
pen, check, notepad, check! i am going to kill this social event today! i am going to leave 30mins earlier too	hit:11861_conv:23723_1_568
Sounds like you are prepared. I like the confident attitude. Go get them!	hit:11861_conv:23723_2_548
i'll sure do that, it's going to be fun too, do you go to social events?	hit:11861_conv:23723_3_568
I would love to come with you to yours. LOL, I just invited myself.	hit:11861_conv:23723_4_548
i don't know how to feel, i've been working so hard the past few months but i feel like i am not getting anywhere, still at the same place as i was 	hit:11863_conv:23727_1_568
I completely understand. Maybe you need a vacation to recharge the batteries.	hit:11863_conv:23727_2_274
maybe, but i also need a plan because if i continue like this, i won't get anywhere for reals	hit:11863_conv:23727_3_568
Are you looking for a new job?	hit:11863_conv:23727_4_274
can i really do everything alone? i just feel so useless	hit:11864_conv:23729_1_568
That's not true I'm sure. Do you have any friends to hang out with?	hit:11864_conv:23729_2_332
no, i don't like people, they make me lose more hope in the plane	hit:11864_conv:23729_3_568
I can understand. Maybe connect with some like-minded people online? 	hit:11864_conv:23729_4_332
last week my friends and i ordered pizza while at their house, after an hour of eating the pizza i pucked everywhere on his couch, i feel so bad and grossed out	hit:11865_conv:23730_1_568
ewww that's gross!  Did you help clean it up?  And what was in that pizza anyway??	hit:11865_conv:23730_2_389
god knows what was in that pizza, but i helped clean and the mess was still showing, but he said it wasn't a problem 	hit:11865_conv:23730_3_568
He seems like a good friend.  	hit:11865_conv:23730_4_389
... everything seems to be everywhere, i am just scared out of my mind of the future	hit:11866_conv:23732_1_568
The future certainly can be scary.	hit:11866_conv:23732_2_322
are you not scared of the future?	hit:11866_conv:23732_3_568
I am curious for what the future holds.	hit:11866_conv:23732_4_322
my mother got a big cake and left it in the fridge for us to eat later, i selfishly took it all upstairs and closed my door and ate all of it while watching anime	hit:11867_conv:23734_1_568
Oh wow, the whole cake? Has she found out yet? Was she mad?	hit:11867_conv:23734_2_332
she hasn't yet, we're suppose to have it later tonight, but how disappointed she'll be when she comes back from work and sees that the cake has been entirely devoured by me... 	hit:11867_conv:23734_3_568
If you can and have time, I'd try to get a quick replacement and explain to her. Maybe she'll understand.	hit:11867_conv:23734_4_332
i created this math formula yesterday for uniquely identifying words! and i am so happy with myself	hit:11869_conv:23738_1_568
Oh cool.  How does it work?	hit:11869_conv:23738_2_389
it seperates the ascii values of each character and adds them up to give a number, then it divides  them by their length and then it does something else which i will keep a secret :P	hit:11869_conv:23738_3_568
Oh that's easy peasy.  Sometimes I only have to wipe once when I go number 2.  	hit:11869_conv:23738_4_389
i never got the chance to get promoted at work even though all my colleagues did!	hit:11872_conv:23745_1_717
Oh man, I would be so jealous. When will it be your turn? 	hit:11872_conv:23745_2_332
i am envying them. i don't know , i'm working very hard as well.	hit:11872_conv:23745_3_717
I think your boss should give you more recognition in that case!	hit:11872_conv:23745_4_332
i care a lot about my family and always want them to be happy	hit:11873_conv:23746_1_717
That's good!  You're awesome!  Family is what is important	hit:11873_conv:23746_2_389
family should always come first. 	hit:11873_conv:23746_3_717
I agree!  	hit:11873_conv:23746_4_389
i am very ready for my first semester in university!	hit:11882_conv:23765_1_717
ready for all those ice breakers? those amazing crazy party? what are you hoping to do this year?	hit:11882_conv:23765_2_706
i am really hoping i can make some good friends, and just learn about everything i don't know a lot about you know?	hit:11882_conv:23765_3_717
yeah defiantly, my best advice to you is to learn and focus on your studying and always expand in knowledge that's the one thing we seniors always wish we had done   	hit:11882_conv:23765_4_706
i was very angry when i learned about what happened	hit:11886_conv:23773_1_717
what? what happend? why are you angry?	hit:11886_conv:23773_2_706
i'm angry because my mom and my sister had a fight and they aren't talking together. that made me very mad.	hit:11886_conv:23773_3_717
really? was it about something very stupid?	hit:11886_conv:23773_4_706
I play guitar as a hobby but rarely play in front of other guitarists.  I only feel comfortable doing it if the people around me play worse or not at all.	hit:11891_conv:23783_1_403
I think that's a kind of natural reaction, especially if it is just a hobby. I would have a fear of being judged.	hit:11891_conv:23783_2_332
Exactly!  I always feel there's less chance of embarrassment if you're the best in the room.	hit:11891_conv:23783_3_403
Definitely. I feel the same speaking foreign languages. It's more of a self-conscious thing.	hit:11891_conv:23783_4_332
i'm looking forward to next week, i'm going on a holiday with my fiance!	hit:11892_conv:23784_1_717
that does sound like fun! where do you guys plan on going?	hit:11892_conv:23784_2_514
well, we are going to turkey! i've heard some good things about that country i'm very excited	hit:11892_conv:23784_3_717
that sounds like a good time. not the usual country you see people vacation to	hit:11892_conv:23784_4_514
i have a lot of hope for the future. i'm going to get married soon, and everything is going to be amazing!	hit:11897_conv:23795_1_717
That's awesome! It's so good that you have such a positive outlook on everything.	hit:11897_conv:23795_2_332
isn't it? i don't see negative things in life, i try to always look at the bright side.	hit:11897_conv:23795_3_717
I think you have the perfect outlook. I hope I can strive to maintain something like that as well.	hit:11897_conv:23795_4_332
i am sad because my brother failed me.	hit:11900_conv:23801_1_717
what did he do yolo?	hit:11900_conv:23801_2_706
he couldn't keep his promise with me. he said he was going to get me pepsi max but he didn't and that made me sad.	hit:11900_conv:23801_3_717
this is absolutely the worst! he is no man in my eyes!	hit:11900_conv:23801_4_706
my brother was sick and he puked in front of me, it smelled horrible	hit:11903_conv:23807_1_717
Oh, yuck! That's gross. Did you get sick too?	hit:11903_conv:23807_2_45
i didn't, but no one was home and i had to clean that up :(	hit:11903_conv:23807_3_717
that's rough! My husband always did with the kids when he was home.	hit:11903_conv:23807_4_45
i am moving out of this country soon and i'm worried about my university, because i'll have a lot of exams to do and not gonna lie i'm stressed out.	hit:11907_conv:23815_1_717
don't be! i know this is overused but trust me, it's not as hard as everyone else makes it to be, if you focus and aim for your goals, you will get it! i know you can do it!	hit:11907_conv:23815_2_706
that was very needed , thank you so much, i was really stressed because of it.	hit:11907_conv:23815_3_717
don't be, i am sure your fiance will always be right next to you and help you out	hit:11907_conv:23815_4_706
global warming is terrifying me. and i'm scared people aren't even realising it.	hit:11913_conv:23827_1_717
It really is, what can we do to help?	hit:11913_conv:23827_2_375
i don't know maybe starting by stop using all those cars ? i don't know i wish we could do something.	hit:11913_conv:23827_3_717
That'd be a good idea, we could all start biking.	hit:11913_conv:23827_4_375
i just delivered the best project at work! 	hit:11917_conv:23835_1_717
What was the project?1	hit:11917_conv:23835_2_375
the project that i worked on was to deliver a marketing speech for healthy eating	hit:11917_conv:23835_3_717
You must be an expert on nutrition then!	hit:11917_conv:23835_4_375
i am so hopeful for the future! 	hit:11918_conv:23837_1_568
What are you looking forward too?	hit:11918_conv:23837_2_375
i am going to see my fiance who lives in adifferent country 	hit:11918_conv:23837_3_568
Which country? that sounds fun, are you guys doing anything fun there?	hit:11918_conv:23837_4_375
candaa	hit:11918_conv:23837_5_568
i am travelling soon, but i am bringing with myself a lithium ion battery for phone replacement to the airport security, i am anticipating the security there so i may talk to the person at the desk to confirm i can take such an item	hit:11920_conv:23840_1_568
yeah. it would be best to check the website for a list of approved items	hit:11920_conv:23840_2_514
the website says yes! but my friends say they don't know if that's accurate so i think i need to double check once i am there	hit:11920_conv:23840_3_568
yes. hopefully all will go well	hit:11920_conv:23840_4_514
i am very happy, my best friend is getting married today	hit:11921_conv:23843_1_717
Are you his best man?	hit:11921_conv:23843_2_375
well , i consider him my brother, i don't know if he thinks the same, we grew up together.	hit:11921_conv:23843_3_717
I hope he does, being the best man is an honour and you're ready for it.	hit:11921_conv:23843_4_375
at work i ended up writing code that is able to detect words that are similar and detect their meaning and cluster them into groups of n clusters 	hit:11922_conv:23845_1_568
sounds quite interesting to code	hit:11922_conv:23845_2_63
it sure is! i used genetic algorithm as well as k-means and neural netwroking	hit:11922_conv:23845_3_568
oh dang i never really dabbled that deep when i did my small share of programming	hit:11922_conv:23845_4_63
i am nervous and scared of my feelings, i feel like in the future they will hurt me	hit:11923_conv:23847_1_568
What happened?	hit:11923_conv:23847_2_375
nothing so far, but it's what migh thappen in the future	hit:11923_conv:23847_3_568
I hope all goes well so you're as happy as possible.	hit:11923_conv:23847_4_375
i saw one of my old friends today	hit:11924_conv:23848_1_717
That's good! I hope you had a good time?	hit:11924_conv:23848_2_45
well it brought back a lot of memories, and it felt nice to see her after all those years.	hit:11924_conv:23848_3_717
Yes, it's great when you run into an old friend you haven't saw for a long time. 	hit:11924_conv:23848_4_45
so greatful to be given this wonderful life	hit:11925_conv:23851_1_568
What are you planning on doing with it?	hit:11925_conv:23851_2_375
build a life with my fiance and grow together and gain more and more knowledge 	hit:11925_conv:23851_3_568
That sounds so admirable, I'd love to see you grow to an amazing person.	hit:11925_conv:23851_4_375
in my room, alone and i am starving	hit:11927_conv:23854_1_568
why don't you go get yourself some food? or just order some?	hit:11927_conv:23854_2_717
i have, but the wait is so real you know?	hit:11927_conv:23854_3_568
oh god i get you! waiting for your food to arrive is real torture.	hit:11927_conv:23854_4_717
i saw a cat the other day it showed up out of nowhere i got really scared.	hit:11927_conv:23855_1_717
wow, spooky, what did you do next?	hit:11927_conv:23855_2_568
i just walked past it.	hit:11927_conv:23855_3_717
that must have startled you 	hit:11927_conv:23855_4_568
... starving once again, this feeling sucks, it gets me all depressed, nothing to eat and the delivery is 1 hour late	hit:11928_conv:23856_1_568
You having money problems?	hit:11928_conv:23856_2_846
yeah! but i still ordered but the food delivery isn't here yet	hit:11928_conv:23856_3_568
I don't think I've ever had a delivery guy be that late. I'd be mad.	hit:11928_conv:23856_4_846
my cat really got on my nerves today! she pooped in the kitchen floor and that was the first thing i saw when i woke up	hit:11929_conv:23858_1_568
Oh, that stinks...literally! I have pets too so I know how you feel. My cat will eat too much sometimes and throw up!	hit:11929_conv:23858_2_45
it's the worst right?... really made me so so so mad	hit:11929_conv:23858_3_568
It is, I wished they could just use the toilet like we do!	hit:11929_conv:23858_4_45
i am so proud of my fiancee, she's been working extra hard.	hit:11930_conv:23860_1_717
thats good! nothing wrong with hard work and dedication	hit:11930_conv:23860_2_514
and seeing her reaching her goals and growing so much makes me so happy.	hit:11930_conv:23860_3_717
that does have to feel really good	hit:11930_conv:23860_4_514
I am very lucky that I live out in the country where the quality of life is so much better than living in the high stress cities	hit:11956_conv:23912_1_725
Yes, where do you live?	hit:11956_conv:23912_2_4
I live in Colorado with the mountains and fresh air with so many wonderful outdoor activities available.	hit:11956_conv:23912_3_725
I love Colorado. I visit all the time.	hit:11956_conv:23912_4_4
It is great any time of the year. There are so many cool things to do even in the snowy winters.	hit:11956_conv:23912_5_725
Sometimes I feel very happy that I am a US resident. When I travel to other countries everyone is so amazed that I am from the US. They treat you very differently because they think that the US is so great, rich and free.	hit:11961_conv:23922_1_725
Yeah, we have a lot to be thankful for.  We take for granted many of the perks of being a US resident!	hit:11961_conv:23922_2_277
That is for sure! I just wish other countries were the same. There are so many people suffering all over the world.	hit:11961_conv:23922_3_725
I agree. There is a lot of suffering.  I am glad people like you and I recognize that.	hit:11961_conv:23922_4_277
I am very happy that my popsicle business is finally thriving! I have worked so hard on it for many years.	hit:11968_conv:23937_1_725
That is great. Where are you selling your popsicle?	hit:11968_conv:23937_2_7
From my house and from a few local stores. I am not ready to make it any bigger than that.	hit:11968_conv:23937_3_725
I understand. Good luck.	hit:11968_conv:23937_4_7
I was so happy to come home the other day and everything was clean and dinner was already on the table. What did I do to deserve that?	hit:11971_conv:23943_1_725
You were probably just being you.	hit:11971_conv:23943_2_754
No, I think somebody wants something... I am just waiting to hear it, lol.	hit:11971_conv:23943_3_725
Haha! That's usually the case. : )	hit:11971_conv:23943_4_754
I lived in New York City for a couple of years and it is definitely a place where one can feel quite alone if you don't have family or friends.	hit:11976_conv:23953_1_725
I understand. Is your family living far from New York?	hit:11976_conv:23953_2_7
Yes, a plane ride away. But there was also a lot of cool things to see. I think it was a good experience but it would be better with friends and family.	hit:11976_conv:23953_3_725
It is always cool to have family and friends close by.	hit:11976_conv:23953_4_7
When I am in nature I feel good that this world is exactly as it should be. Everything is moving along to Gods plans.	hit:11979_conv:23959_1_725
That is a great mindset to have!  You must feel very happy and content!	hit:11979_conv:23959_2_277
Yes, when I am in nature. :) But when I come to the big cities I feel like it is the devils playgrounds	hit:11979_conv:23959_3_725
Why do cities make you feel that way?	hit:11979_conv:23959_4_277
Because they are filled with concrete and pollution and unhappy people.	hit:11979_conv:23959_5_725
 feel so bad, I forgot again to fill the gas tank up in the car after I used it all. My friend is going to kill me!	hit:11982_conv:23965_1_725
Oh no.. and no one really likes pumping gas. 	hit:11982_conv:23965_2_11
I just seem to forget until I get home. Oh well I will just have to give her some money again instead. Oh she is going to be angry.	hit:11982_conv:23965_3_725
You could grab it when shes done with it and fill it up real quick for her! 	hit:11982_conv:23965_4_11
Nah, I will just give her the money and endure the pain. Haha	hit:11982_conv:23965_5_725
just got back from grocery shopping, The cashier gave me back $10 more change than I supposed to get	hit:11983_conv:23967_1_675
Did you give it back or just walk away?	hit:11983_conv:23967_2_277
i did not find out untill i got home, the store is kind of far and I think I'm going to keep it, but it's eating on my conscious because of that	hit:11983_conv:23967_3_675
Yeah, that is a hard one to deal with.  Maybe you should give it back so you will not feel bad about yourself.	hit:11983_conv:23967_4_277
I feel a little weird about looking at this house for sale. It looks haunted and I think something bad happened there, but not sure.	hit:11984_conv:23969_1_725
I would ask the realtor on some background and even google the address to see if any abuse headlines come from that place. 	hit:11984_conv:23969_2_11
That is a good idea. It is such good deal and I think it would not need much money to fix it up. But a ghost in the house is definitely a deal breaker!	hit:11984_conv:23969_3_725
Kinda makes you think even more since its such a good deal that people are just like get rid of it - deff look into it! 	hit:11984_conv:23969_4_11
When bad things happen I get too emotional. I think more than other do. Sometimes I think I am crazy.	hit:11988_conv:23976_1_725
I'm sorry to hear that...sometime you just have stop and take a deep breathe so you don't get overwhelmed.	hit:11988_conv:23976_2_842
Yeah, I know. But in the moment it is hard. I guess I am just a very emotional person. Maybe I need theraoy, lol.	hit:11988_conv:23976_3_725
Therapy is a good thing. Its is nothing to be ashamed of.	hit:11988_conv:23976_4_842
I have faith that I will get pregnant soon. Why is it so hard? Isn't that what a women's body is built to do?	hit:11990_conv:23981_1_725
Maybe it isnt your body, but also your partners! Something to check into to see which end its coming from, but none the less it will happen! 	hit:11990_conv:23981_2_11
Yeah, more people are having these issues these days. I think it may be true that someone may be poisoning us through the water and food or something! It is a scary world!	hit:11990_conv:23981_3_725
It's hard to trust anything, even the oatmeal recently was put on the news that its high in cancer causing pest spray. 	hit:11990_conv:23981_4_11
I found a lost baby duck. The mother was no where to be found. I brought it home and took care of it until it was big enough to be let loose again.	hit:11993_conv:23987_1_725
Thats kind of you, did everything go well when you put it back into the wild? 	hit:11993_conv:23987_2_11
The duck flew away and was never to be found again. Hopefully he was reunited somehow with his family. I just hope so.	hit:11993_conv:23987_3_725
Sounds like it went well! 	hit:11993_conv:23987_4_11
I feel so upset when other people tell such horrible lies about other people. Some people are just cruel and are only out for themselves.	hit:11997_conv:23995_1_725
Yes, I hate those kind of people. They have nothing to do expect lying about other people.	hit:11997_conv:23995_2_7
Yeah, it is very hurtful. But what can one do? Get back at them? It just seems like you would go to their level. I guess it is better to just swallow it and move on.	hit:11997_conv:23995_3_725
I just ignore them. At some point, they stop but they understand that it is not working.	hit:11997_conv:23995_4_7
This past week my 3 year old son caught strep throat. I ended up having to miss the entire week at work to stay home with him.	hit:11998_conv:23997_1_340
I'm sorry to hear that. I hope he is feeling better. 	hit:11998_conv:23997_2_842
He is, i hated missing work, but that the sort of thing a person has to do for their children.	hit:11998_conv:23997_3_340
It is. Taking care of sick child is hard. Missing work is also hard. The things we have to do for our children.	hit:11998_conv:23997_4_842
My high heel broke in the cement the other morning and I had to wear them all day at work. Not a good day!	hit:11999_conv:23999_1_725
Sounds like something on a movie! What a work day right, my god. Bring extras next time? lol 	hit:11999_conv:23999_2_11
Yeah, from now on I will have an extra pair in my desk. Everyone was teasing me all day. It was so annoying!	hit:11999_conv:23999_3_725
I bet they were lol atleast you can laugh about it now. 	hit:11999_conv:23999_4_11
My father continuously gambles all his earnings away even though he has two minors to support.	hit:12000_conv:24000_1_580
That's very sad, has he considered getting help for his addiction?	hit:12000_conv:24000_2_100
Nope, he doesn't care and denies it's an issue. When I found out, I was too angry to look at him.	hit:12000_conv:24000_3_580
I can certainly understand your feelings, I hope he can somehow fix his habits.	hit:12000_conv:24000_4_100
My friends and I started playing Halo online recently.	hit:12002_conv:24005_1_580
Has it been a lot of fun?	hit:12002_conv:24005_2_100
Incredibly so. It brought back so many great memories from the times we played on the Xbox 360.	hit:12002_conv:24005_3_580
Oh yeah I remember those old Halo days too during my childhood, such a great game.	hit:12002_conv:24005_4_100
I feel happy to just stay in and watch a movie at home on a Saturday night. I have no desire to go out and party like most people I know do.	hit:12004_conv:24009_1_725
I understand that feeling. It wouldn't make sense for us all to want to do the same things, especially if you've partied before already.	hit:12004_conv:24009_2_128
Yeah, been there done that. I don't miss those hangovers on Sunday morning. Totally not worth it anymore.	hit:12004_conv:24009_3_725
That's cool that you know what you want from life right now and that you don't feel obligated to do things just because of norms.	hit:12004_conv:24009_4_128
Last month,finally, after years of working towards it, I was finally promoted into senior management at my job.	hit:12005_conv:24011_1_340
Oh that's great! Does it come with a nice raise?	hit:12005_conv:24011_2_53
Yes it did, and much better benefits. Seems like I finally got to the end of a very long road.	hit:12005_conv:24011_3_340
Do you kind of feel like there's no where else to go?	hit:12005_conv:24011_4_53
After working for years at a job I didn't like, and struggling in school, I found a new job that coincides with my Major.	hit:12006_conv:24013_1_580
I am so happy for you! All of your hard work paid off!	hit:12006_conv:24013_2_842
Thanks! For the first time in a long time, the future isn't looking so dark.	hit:12006_conv:24013_3_580
That is great accomplishment! I wish you well on your new path in life!	hit:12006_conv:24013_4_842
Last week at work, I went to sit down at my desk chair and completely missed it and fell straight into the floor.	hit:12007_conv:24014_1_340
Oh my...I hope you didn't hurt yourself.	hit:12007_conv:24014_2_842
Just my pride. My boss and a couple coworkers got a good view of me just flopping into the floor as documents and paperwork went flying.	hit:12007_conv:24014_3_340
Since you didn't hurt yourself I think I will have to laugh. It sounds like it was funny.	hit:12007_conv:24014_4_842
I know I should not feel like this but I feel so envious when I drive through the rich neighborhoods and I know that I will never be able to live there.	hit:12008_conv:24017_1_725
Yea, I feel the same way.  It's worse when you have to pass by them twice a day.	hit:12008_conv:24017_2_85
I have to pass twice a day too. Oh well, I should just be grateful for what I have now. I just can't help that feeling from creeping in though. Maybe I will buy a lottery ticket, lol.	hit:12008_conv:24017_3_725
Heck no.  Be envious that they were lucky enough to have their parents hand down all their money to them.	hit:12008_conv:24017_4_85
Last month my wife and I ordered our first new car with a delivery time of six weeks. 	hit:12009_conv:24018_1_340
Oooh, how exciting!! What kind of car did you get?	hit:12009_conv:24018_2_104
We ordered a new Ford Superduty pickup. This six weeks is taking forever.	hit:12009_conv:24018_3_340
I'll bet it is! Best of luck with your new truck!	hit:12009_conv:24018_4_104
In the 6th grade, a bird pooped on my back during lunchtime.	hit:12010_conv:24021_1_580
Indoors?	hit:12010_conv:24021_2_298
Nah we were having a barbecue outdoors. 	hit:12010_conv:24021_3_580
In the 6th grade? Where is this school?	hit:12010_conv:24021_4_298
In Quebec. All schools have a budget for extra-curricular activities and events. We had a barbecue once every year in June with free food.	hit:12010_conv:24021_5_580
Makes sense. I live in the states. We have no money for such things.	hit:12010_conv:24021_6_298
That sounds awful, all schools need a budget for activities for the students. Anyways I had no replacement shirt and I had to rinse it out and wear it for the rest of the day; I felt sick.	hit:12010_conv:24021_7_580
How big a bird was this. I dont remember anything from the 6th grade.	hit:12010_conv:24021_8_298
Last month, a buddy of mine bought a scratch off ticket and won $4500. I never win anything when I buy them.	hit:12012_conv:24024_1_340
Wow!! That's crazy. I'm like that though. I never win anything either	hit:12012_conv:24024_2_607
I mean I am happy for him and all, but I wouldn't mind some found money either.	hit:12012_conv:24024_3_340
haha right! Maybe you should buy a few and see what happens. You cant win if you don't play	hit:12012_conv:24024_4_607
Our puppy wiggled out of his leash. He ran toward the busy road and was hit by a car. It was awful	hit:12012_conv:24025_1_607
Oh god, I am so sorry. Is he okay now?	hit:12012_conv:24025_2_340
Sadly, no. He passed away at the vet a few hours later.	hit:12012_conv:24025_3_607
I hate to hear that. It is so hard to lose a pet. I hope you are doing okay through this.	hit:12012_conv:24025_4_340
coincidence, I too I'm taking a trip but a business one, I 'm not looking forward to flying	hit:12013_conv:24027_1_675
Do you not fly often? It isnt too bad.	hit:12013_conv:24027_2_297
a couple of time, but it truly scares me	hit:12013_conv:24027_3_675
Well if it is a bigger plane it isnt as bad. Just bring some headphones and listen to some comforting music.	hit:12013_conv:24027_4_297
The other day I forgot to take my anti-anxiety medication.	hit:12014_conv:24028_1_580
You have to be more careful next time, maybe you need a calendar to remind you.	hit:12014_conv:24028_2_653
I put an alarm on my phone, I just get so busy some mornings. At least it didn't affect me too bad until the next morning.	hit:12014_conv:24028_3_580
I am so sorry to hear, I am glad that it didn't cause a lasting effect.	hit:12014_conv:24028_4_653
I am feeling pretty good after my interview for a promotion at work last week. My boss told me I nailed the interview.	hit:12016_conv:24032_1_340
That is a fantastic feeling. I hope you get it.	hit:12016_conv:24032_2_297
Well I have almost twice the experience as the other two candidates, so I have a really good feeling about it.	hit:12016_conv:24032_3_340
Keep riding that confidence. It will get you places. It sounds like you deserve it.	hit:12016_conv:24032_4_297
The other night, drunk bicyclists were following me home and laughing on the sidewalk.	hit:12017_conv:24035_1_580
That must have been a bit scary, You should have called the police.	hit:12017_conv:24035_2_653
I wasn't too far from my home so I figured I could tough it out. I was pretty scared however, especially since it was nighttime. 	hit:12017_conv:24035_3_580
You cannot be too careful these days, i am so sorry that happened to you.	hit:12017_conv:24035_4_653
NASA released some free space posters a couple of months back.	hit:12020_conv:24041_1_580
Okay! Now that is interested, I would love to see them.	hit:12020_conv:24041_2_653
I think they have them up on their website, you should give them a look! I had them printed for a small fee and now they're up on my wall!	hit:12020_conv:24041_3_580
Oh really? I will be checking it out. I would love to have some.	hit:12020_conv:24041_4_653
"Yup. The poster files are free, you just have to get them printed somewhere. They have a few different themes. I got Europa, Trappist-1e, Mars Explorers Wanted and ""We Need You"""	hit:12020_conv:24041_5_580
Free? That makes it even better, I will be getting me some posters.	hit:12020_conv:24041_6_653
Sweet! I hope you like them as much as I do!	hit:12020_conv:24041_7_580
I hope so too. Thank you so much!	hit:12020_conv:24041_8_653
Yesterday I found a massive spider in my room.	hit:12022_conv:24045_1_580
I am afraid of spiders. I would run and scream. What happened afterwards?	hit:12022_conv:24045_2_653
It ran off somewhere and I couldn't find it, even though I moved most of my furniture. I'm a little scared.	hit:12022_conv:24045_3_580
I would move out of that room. Maybe you need to spray the area.	hit:12022_conv:24045_4_653
There was a chance that it could rain on the day my best friends and I went camping.	hit:12026_conv:24052_1_580
Oh no! Did it end up raining? Did you take rain gear?	hit:12026_conv:24052_2_243
It barely did at night, but for the few days we went camping it was nice weather! I'm so thankful that it didn't, because we made a lot of nice memories during our trip.	hit:12026_conv:24052_3_580
That sounds like it was a lot of fun!	hit:12026_conv:24052_4_243
looks like we have something in common, when i walk through my house, the rooms are empty. There are no one here but me	hit:12027_conv:24055_1_675
Im sorry to hear that it can be hard ;/	hit:12027_conv:24055_2_46
i know, i am trying to cope but the emptiness is unbearable	hit:12027_conv:24055_3_675
Yeah i would get a pet	hit:12027_conv:24055_4_46
I was watching over my girlfriend's cat while she went away on a little trip.	hit:12029_conv:24058_1_580
That is so sweet of you. I love cats, you must be a caring spouse.	hit:12029_conv:24058_2_653
I like to think so, thanks! Unfortunately, the cat wanted barely anything to do with me and I felt so isolated.	hit:12029_conv:24058_3_580
The cat didn't like you, oh dear. I am so sorry that happened. You need to spend more time with the cat.	hit:12029_conv:24058_4_653
 Ever since I started taking medication for anxiety and depression, I've been gaining weight. 	hit:12033_conv:24066_1_580
I have heard that is a common side effect but you might want to talk to your doctor about it	hit:12033_conv:24066_2_46
I have, she said I'm okay because I still have a healthy weight. I've been a skinny boy all my life, and I still am but this extra chub has me feeling down.	hit:12033_conv:24066_3_580
Well you could always work out and turn it into muscle	hit:12033_conv:24066_4_46
 No matter who comes to the door, my dog barks.	hit:12039_conv:24078_1_580
Its a good guard dog then	hit:12039_conv:24078_2_126
In a way yes, but not really. As soon as anyone ENTERS the house, he turns into a huge lovable pup and wants them to pet him. He's such a nuisance but I love him.	hit:12039_conv:24078_3_580
What kind of dog is he	hit:12039_conv:24078_4_126
A Brittany Spaniel.	hit:12039_conv:24078_5_580
I was driving down the highway when I saw a car in an accident. It seems they hit a cow! Oh my!	hit:12053_conv:24106_1_725
Animal accidents can be really bad!	hit:12053_conv:24106_2_655
I felt so bad for the poor cow. It seems no one was hurt except the cow. :( The car was pretty damaged though.	hit:12053_conv:24106_3_725
At least no one else was injured, but it is sad about the cow. 	hit:12053_conv:24106_4_655
my pet dog is getting older. I know one day she won't be around anymore	hit:12055_conv:24111_1_675
Just cherish the moments	hit:12055_conv:24111_2_126
I will, but just the thought of it makes me blue	hit:12055_conv:24111_3_675
It will be okay	hit:12055_conv:24111_4_126
I put in a lot of effort and energy and I found a new job!	hit:12058_conv:24116_1_580
What kind of job is it	hit:12058_conv:24116_2_126
It's an online teaching position and I feel so good about myself. 	hit:12058_conv:24116_3_580
That is a nice job I am sure	hit:12058_conv:24116_4_126
I came home drunk from the bar and stole my neighbor's package that was sitting out.	hit:12069_conv:24139_1_473
Uh oh! Did you get in trouble?	hit:12069_conv:24139_2_243
No, but I felt like a jerk when I gave it to them the next day and had to explain what happened.	hit:12069_conv:24139_3_473
That is good that you gave it back and were able to admit your mistake. I am sure they appreciate that.	hit:12069_conv:24139_4_243
With all the money I've been saving up, I should be able to purchase an Oculus Rift Virtual Reality system soon!	hit:12078_conv:24156_1_580
Awesome, congrats! I'm not too familiar with the Oculus Rift, is there a particular game you're eager to play?	hit:12078_conv:24156_2_473
Hmm maybe Robo Recall, a game about fighting robots. Otherwise I have to find out what games are available!	hit:12078_conv:24156_3_580
Robot games are always fun. I bet you'll have a great time!	hit:12078_conv:24156_4_473
I went on a new bike trail the other day, it was super fun but also a little scary.	hit:12078_conv:24157_1_473
Ooh how so? Were there a lot of hills and sharp turns?	hit:12078_conv:24157_2_580
Yep, exactly. I also have a new bike so between the new route and the new bike, I was totally terrified of wiping out. So I took it slow.	hit:12078_conv:24157_3_473
I see. Do you think you'll be going back on that bike trail?	hit:12078_conv:24157_4_580
Absolutely! And now that I know it better, I won't be so scared. I'm heading back out there Tuesday, can't wait!	hit:12078_conv:24157_5_473
I hope you have tons of fun and enjoy a safe trip!	hit:12078_conv:24157_6_580
I made a new friend at a convention I was volunteering at. I was shocked.	hit:12082_conv:24164_1_580
What kind of con was it	hit:12082_conv:24164_2_46
Otakuthon 2018. It's about anime, Japanese culture and videogames. I was volunteering for the MSI booth (a PC-Gaming company).	hit:12082_conv:24164_3_580
that is really cool! I like in Texas so i cant go to stuff like that	hit:12082_conv:24164_4_46
That's a shame. Anyways, I haven't made any friends in well over a year because I'm awful in social situations.	hit:12082_conv:24164_5_580
I participated in a ropes course with my colleagues, we had to learn how to trust each other.	hit:12086_conv:24172_1_473
That sounds amazing!  How did everyone do?	hit:12086_conv:24172_2_90
Pretty good. The hardest part for most of us was the blind trust fall, but in the end most of us learned to put faith in each other.	hit:12086_conv:24172_3_473
Awesome!  Hopefully what you guys learned in the ropes course translates over into the workplace.	hit:12086_conv:24172_4_90
I let my little sister go into my wallet and grab my credit card so she can order something online for herself.	hit:12088_conv:24176_1_580
Why did you do tht?	hit:12088_conv:24176_2_10
She's very trustworthy and I knew she wouldn't steal from me. It was also something she needed and didn't have the money to get it yet.	hit:12088_conv:24176_3_580
That makes sense, you are a good older sibling!	hit:12088_conv:24176_4_10
Thanks for the compliment! But she's also a great younger sibling!	hit:12088_conv:24176_5_580
 I once drank six pints of beer in a night and ended up getting very sick.	hit:12095_conv:24190_1_580
I would imagine, that is a lot to drink!	hit:12095_conv:24190_2_10
It really is. I felt so bad about my actions, but it hasn't stopped me from doing it at least one other time.	hit:12095_conv:24190_3_580
I get that, well I hope you feel betternow!	hit:12095_conv:24190_4_10
I never learned how to ride a bike.	hit:12098_conv:24196_1_580
why is that?	hit:12098_conv:24196_2_10
My parents never saw the importance I guess. 	hit:12098_conv:24196_3_580
I get that, did your friends know how to ride bikes?	hit:12098_conv:24196_4_10
They did, but I was always too scared and not confident enough in myself. I thought I would fall and really hurt myself.	hit:12098_conv:24196_5_580
Well it is never hard to learn if you give it a shot	hit:12098_conv:24196_6_10
My girlfriend made the cutest and most touching card for my birthday.	hit:12099_conv:24199_1_580
Aww that's sweet. Did you cry?	hit:12099_conv:24199_2_27
I almost did. It was hard holding the tears back.	hit:12099_conv:24199_3_580
Why hold them back? It okay to cry lol	hit:12099_conv:24199_4_27
My cat has terminal kidney failure. There's no cure.	hit:12100_conv:24200_1_473
Oh, I am so sorry! I used to have a dog we loved so much who had diabetes...we gave him insulin shots twice a day but we lost him. I can relate to how you feel... 	hit:12100_conv:24200_2_684
It really sucks. It's fairly common in cats and I sort of knew the diagnosis was coming but that doesn't make it any easier. I'm sorry to hear about your dog.	hit:12100_conv:24200_3_473
Our pets are our family...it's not easy to see them suffer..I feel for you. And thank you about our dog.	hit:12100_conv:24200_4_684
I received horrific news from a best friend recently.	hit:12101_conv:24203_1_580
Oh no,  what happened?	hit:12101_conv:24203_2_203
They had tried to commit suicide. It was very hard to hear but thankfully they are getting the help they need.	hit:12101_conv:24203_3_580
That is terrible, you must have been devastated,  I hope he find the help he/she needs.	hit:12101_conv:24203_4_203
you know at work, one of my coworker is always singing to himself, it bugs me	hit:12104_conv:24208_1_675
Oh dear, but are you allowed to sing at work? That must be so annoying.	hit:12104_conv:24208_2_653
it really is, he thinks he knows how to sing, i would not be so annoying if he knew how to sing 	hit:12104_conv:24208_3_675
He needs to just sing in the shower. Tell him to quit singing.	hit:12104_conv:24208_4_653
One time I slipped on a banana peel	hit:12107_conv:24214_1_547
Haha no way, I thought that only happens in cartoons!	hit:12107_conv:24214_2_473
Yep, everyone was laughing at me	hit:12107_conv:24214_3_547
I'm sorry but I probably would have, too. Hopefully you didn't get hurt though!	hit:12107_conv:24214_4_473
My neighbor was recently diagnosed with a pretty bad form of cancer.	hit:12107_conv:24215_1_473
That is unfortunate, is he doing any chemotherapy ?	hit:12107_conv:24215_2_547
I'm not entirely sure of the regimen, I didn't want to ask too many questions. But I've been bringing pre-cooked meals over for her and her husband when I get a chance to help them out a little.	hit:12107_conv:24215_3_473
Well I hope everything works out for him!	hit:12107_conv:24215_4_547
One time I was waiting all day for the mail man to deliver my package	hit:12109_conv:24218_1_547
What were you waiting for!	hit:12109_conv:24218_2_277
I was waiting for my computer monitor!	hit:12109_conv:24218_3_547
Nice!  The anticipation must have been killing you!	hit:12109_conv:24218_4_277
I ran out of laundry soap the other day, when I went to the store I grabbed a brand I hadn't used in many years.	hit:12111_conv:24222_1_473
How well did it work out for you?	hit:12111_conv:24222_2_277
Oh it worked fine, but when I pulled my laundry out it surprised me how the smell of that soap reminded me of my life all those years ago when I used it regularly. Isn't it weird how scents can do that?	hit:12111_conv:24222_3_473
Wow!  That is such a great feeling!  I love when good memories come back to me!	hit:12111_conv:24222_4_277
Right? I didn't expect that could happen with laundry soap!	hit:12111_conv:24222_5_473
One time I saw my husband looking at another women	hit:12113_conv:24226_1_547
o no what did you do?	hit:12113_conv:24226_2_46
I slapped him and beat up the other women	hit:12113_conv:24226_3_547
o no im not sure that was the best response	hit:12113_conv:24226_4_46
I was leaving the bar the other day with my boyfriend and tripped on the step just outside the door.	hit:12115_conv:24230_1_473
Oh No! Did you get hurt?	hit:12115_conv:24230_2_243
Well, physically not so much, just a light scrape on my knee. But man my pride got wounded bad!	hit:12115_conv:24230_3_473
I bet that was a little embarrassing. 	hit:12115_conv:24230_4_243
I was a cigarette smoker for nearly an entire decade. In retrospect this is slightly embarrassing. 	hit:12117_conv:24235_1_588
Don't be embarrassed. You know that you had a problem and you are better now for it	hit:12117_conv:24235_2_64
Right. Not much that can be done about it now. I enjoy having more money now though for sure!	hit:12117_conv:24235_3_588
That's understandable. I wish you the best in staying smoke free!	hit:12117_conv:24235_4_64
Being a parent so far has not been anywhere near as difficult as I expected it to be. My daughter is awesome!	hit:12118_conv:24237_1_588
That is great to hear that things are going well for you.	hit:12118_conv:24237_2_243
Thanks that means a lot to me!	hit:12118_conv:24237_3_588
I am sure that things will continue to go smooth since you have a positive attitude about it.	hit:12118_conv:24237_4_243
I was waiting to hear back about a potential job offer, I really wanted the job.	hit:12126_conv:24253_1_473
How long has it been since the interview?	hit:12126_conv:24253_2_119
That's the thing, my anxiety and excitement started the moment I first talked to the company, it was driving me crazy. But I ended up getting the job!	hit:12126_conv:24253_3_473
Oh well congrats and good job!	hit:12126_conv:24253_4_119
My friend just won $500 in scratch-off lottery tickets!	hit:12135_conv:24270_1_473
Oh that is awesome for your friend!	hit:12135_conv:24270_2_243
Oh totally. I'm happy for her but part of me was also a little envious, I hate to admit.	hit:12135_conv:24270_3_473
Yeah I can understand that. I would feel the same.	hit:12135_conv:24270_4_243
Well good, I don't feel so bad about it then. I thought I was being a bad friend!	hit:12135_conv:24270_5_473
I took on a challenging speed bike course recently that was above my skill level.	hit:12139_conv:24278_1_473
That was probably not a good idea, how did it go for you?	hit:12139_conv:24278_2_340
It actually worked out amazing! I knew going into it that I'd practiced a lot and had built up my skills, so I was sure I could do it even if I was a little hesitant.	hit:12139_conv:24278_3_473
Well, you never know if you can do something till you try. I am glad you were able to do so well.	hit:12139_conv:24278_4_340
When I was interviewing for a promotion at my job. I did all I could to get ready for the interview. 	hit:12139_conv:24279_1_340
That can be kind of scary. How did it go?	hit:12139_conv:24279_2_473
It went great. I having put in all the work ahead of time to get ready, I knew exactly how to answer the questions they had for me. 	hit:12139_conv:24279_3_340
Awesome, congratulations! It just goes to show how great things can happen when you're prepared.	hit:12139_conv:24279_4_473
At my job a coworker took credit for a job I had completed. Once I found out, I went straight to my boss and got it straightened out.	hit:12144_conv:24288_1_340
Good job.  Your coworker sounds like a shady little b**ch did you let him/her know what's up	hit:12144_conv:24288_2_119
I found them and gave them a piece of my mind. What kind of person does something like that.	hit:12144_conv:24288_3_340
For real.  Glad you had enough self-respect to handle it, most people dont'	hit:12144_conv:24288_4_119
We went camping this summer and my boyfriend made fun of me for packing so much stuff.	hit:12147_conv:24295_1_473
Aww haha how many bags did you bring	hit:12147_conv:24295_2_119
It honestly wasn't *that* much stuff, I packed it well. But the joke's on him, he felt dumb for making fun of me after we needed a bottle opener and I just so happened to pack one.	hit:12147_conv:24295_3_473
Heey there you go...sounds like you're the resourceful one	hit:12147_conv:24295_4_119
This couple just moved into my building and have been having loud parties almost every night!	hit:12149_conv:24299_1_473
That sounds awful!	hit:12149_conv:24299_2_99
Yeah, it's really irritating. I don't mind people having fun but come on, every single night? It's really ticking me off.	hit:12149_conv:24299_3_473
Have you tried talking to them about it?	hit:12149_conv:24299_4_99
Yes, I casually mentioned condo rules on noise and asked them to at least try and keep it down on weekdays.	hit:12149_conv:24299_5_473
An actual ice cream man came through my neighborhood! I didn't think they still exist.	hit:12153_conv:24306_1_473
I don't think that I have seen/heard one of those since the 90s... Possibly the early 2000's at the earliest! Crazy, I didn't know that they still exist either!	hit:12153_conv:24306_2_588
Right? Seeing the kids come running out really made me miss when I was little and got all excited about the ice cream man!	hit:12153_conv:24306_3_473
I loved that too!	hit:12153_conv:24306_4_588
I am content with my life. I have nothing to complain about, luckily!	hit:12153_conv:24307_1_588
That is wonderful to hear, good for you. There's way too much craziness in the world making people unhappy. It's nice to hear someone is doing well and happy.	hit:12153_conv:24307_2_473
Agreed. I have to actively distance myself away from the drama of reality but doing this makes me happier. Not sure if this is ideal but that's ok!	hit:12153_conv:24307_3_588
Distancing yourself from the negative things sounds like a totally healthy way to insulate yourself from that stuff.	hit:12153_conv:24307_4_473
I was cleaning out the attic last week, and came across a box of old photo albums and some of my childhood things. I sat for hours just looking at old photos.	hit:12155_conv:24311_1_340
Aw, that must have brought up a lot of nostalgia for you. 	hit:12155_conv:24311_2_652
It really did. Seeing all those old faces I haven't seen for years. It was a great experience.	hit:12155_conv:24311_3_340
Did you share it with anyone else?	hit:12155_conv:24311_4_652
I recently applied for a job with a  new company. It would be such a step up for my family if I got it.	hit:12157_conv:24314_1_340
Nice, a step up is always such a relief. Do you feel confident you'll get the job?	hit:12157_conv:24314_2_473
Some, I did well in the interview. Just trying to keep spirits up while they make their decision.	hit:12157_conv:24314_3_340
Well I hope you get it. Good luck!	hit:12157_conv:24314_4_473
I'm waiting to hear about a lucrative job opportunity, it would pretty much be my dream job.	hit:12157_conv:24315_1_473
That's great. How long are you going to have to wait?	hit:12157_conv:24315_2_340
Not sure, hopefully I hear this upcoming week. I feel pretty good about my chances so that's making the waiting a little easier.	hit:12157_conv:24315_3_473
I am glad you are so confident about your prospects. I hope you hear something very soon from them.	hit:12157_conv:24315_4_340
Most of the decisions that I made as a teenager were kind of embarrassing in retrospect.	hit:12158_conv:24316_1_588
I think we've all been there...I've done my fair share of dumbassery	hit:12158_conv:24316_2_119
I feel it. Most of the bad decisions were fun, at least.	hit:12158_conv:24316_3_588
Ha YOLOOO	hit:12158_conv:24316_4_119
I can't wait until all the trees change colors and the weather starts getting cold. I love Autumn!	hit:12160_conv:24320_1_725
I know right! I noticed leaves on the ground the other day and got all excited! Is autumn your favorite season, too?	hit:12160_conv:24320_2_473
Yes! My absolute favorite! It's not too cold and not too hot and there is so much beauty all around! It is soon time to get all the winter clothes out.	hit:12160_conv:24320_3_725
I don't mind winter either but you're so right, the temperature is just right during fall.	hit:12160_conv:24320_4_473
I worked really hard on this project for work and it totally bombed.	hit:12160_conv:24321_1_473
Awe, sorry to hear that. I am sure you did better than you think.	hit:12160_conv:24321_2_725
Well, not really according to analytics. I was really let down by the fact that it was a flop but I'm not going to let it drag me down too much.	hit:12160_conv:24321_3_473
That is a good attitude. Better luck next time!	hit:12160_conv:24321_4_725
The house is all cleaned and ready for my guests. Wow, I was cleaning all day!	hit:12163_conv:24327_1_725
I was doing the same thing!  Hard work but so satisfying when you see the results!  Who is coming to stay?	hit:12163_conv:24327_2_438
Yes, there is no better satisfaction, in my opinion, than a clean house. :) My sister is visiting with her kids. They are staying for a week here at my house. I am sure the house is going to be trashed in the end.	hit:12163_conv:24327_3_725
I completely agree.  Mine can get trashed in 10 minutes flat from the kids.  ha ha. Oh, how fun!  I hope you have a wonderful time!  Yeah, you'll probably be cleaning all over again by the end of it but its worth it.	hit:12163_conv:24327_4_438
My neighbor sits out on his balcony butt naked sometimes.	hit:12165_conv:24330_1_473
That sounds pretty disturbing.  Have you called the cops?	hit:12165_conv:24330_2_294
No but that might be a good idea. It's just an awkward and gross situation.	hit:12165_conv:24330_3_473
I bet.  I wonder what he is thinking.	hit:12165_conv:24330_4_294
I have fixed up house to the best of my ability. I feel very certain that it will sell very quickly.	hit:12167_conv:24335_1_725
I certainly hope so,  Why do you want to move?	hit:12167_conv:24335_2_203
I am moving to a smaller house with a big yard where life will be a lot easier. Less house to clean and more time outside. :)	hit:12167_conv:24335_3_725
That sounds great, That is how I like my houses to be too.	hit:12167_conv:24335_4_203
I feel confident that eating a fruitarian diet will give me more energy and happiness.	hit:12172_conv:24344_1_725
Hmm, don't you need fat and protein in your diet also?	hit:12172_conv:24344_2_473
I have done a lot of research and so many fruitarians are thriving and feeling the best they ever had in their life. There is fat in avocados and avocados are considered a fruit..	hit:12172_conv:24344_3_725
Oh I hadn't even thought of avocado. Well good luck with the diet, I hope it works for you!	hit:12172_conv:24344_4_473
I wrote an email to a family member I haven't spoken to in a long time and I wasn't sure how they'd take everything I said in it.	hit:12172_conv:24345_1_473
Oh wow! That is a brave thing to do! Your letter must have been a little intense if you are worried how they will take it. How did it work out?	hit:12172_conv:24345_2_725
Yep, it was full of emotion and a lot of things I needed to get off my chest. I was quite nervous waiting for a response but it turns out I had nothing to worry about. She was really glad I spoke up!	hit:12172_conv:24345_3_473
Awe that is great! I am glad there was a happy ending!	hit:12172_conv:24345_4_725
I get so mad when the local kids throw eggs at the front doors of houses in my neighborhood. It is so infuriating!	hit:12178_conv:24357_1_725
Oh man I'd be mad too...you should wait outside with a paintball gun 	hit:12178_conv:24357_2_119
Yeah! I wish I had the time for it! I am going to buy one of the web cams and catch them in the act. I am going to teach them a lesson! But I love the paintball idea! That is great! 	hit:12178_conv:24357_3_725
Yup gotta lay down the law	hit:12178_conv:24357_4_119
I moved into this new house and was woken up with this horrible screeching noise in the middle of the night.	hit:12186_conv:24373_1_473
Terrifying! What was it?	hit:12186_conv:24373_2_438
It turned out to be the sump pump, I guess it was old. But yes, it scared the daylights out of me!	hit:12186_conv:24373_3_473
Oh good. I bet!  I wouldn't have been able to go back to sleep after that!  Do you have to replace the pump?	hit:12186_conv:24373_4_438
I did, yeah. It was actually still in working condition but I couldn't stand the sound and I'm a light sleeper. No more scary noises at 3am!	hit:12186_conv:24373_5_473
I made a really inappropriate joke about a coworker to some other people I work with and it got back to him.	hit:12195_conv:24391_1_473
Oops. I hate when that happens. Did they say anything to you?	hit:12195_conv:24391_2_49
No, but the person who told him confessed. So I decided to be the bigger person and apologize to my coworker before things got too out of hand. He actually wasn't that upset and appreciated that I owned up to it, but I still felt bad for it, mostly that I did it behind his back.	hit:12195_conv:24391_3_473
That was really nice of you to apologize like that. Some people would have just ignored it. I know that could have been embarrassing.	hit:12195_conv:24391_4_49
I got my work done early on Friday so I got to spend the day trying out a new bike trail on my new bike!	hit:12198_conv:24396_1_473
that sounds exciting! Do you bike a lot?	hit:12198_conv:24396_2_557
I've only recently started getting really into it. It sounds kind of corny but getting out there on my bike makes life just really... satisfying. Calm.	hit:12198_conv:24396_3_473
Doesn't sound corny. We all need a hobby to relieve stress!	hit:12198_conv:24396_4_557
I miss being able to take my children to the park.	hit:12204_conv:24408_1_327
How come you can't take them anymore?	hit:12204_conv:24408_2_286
they are all grown up. 	hit:12204_conv:24408_3_327
Awww, well maybe you'll have grandchildren that you can take one day!	hit:12204_conv:24408_4_286
"I studied all night for my final exam"""	hit:12205_conv:24411_1_547
That's intense. I hope you did well!	hit:12205_conv:24411_2_64
I did! I got an A and I am so proud and happy !	hit:12205_conv:24411_3_547
Congratulations! That's great news. Well deserved	hit:12205_conv:24411_4_64
the neighbor's dog barked all night and kept me up, let's say I am not very happy right now	hit:12207_conv:24415_1_675
I totally understand. The same thing happened to me last week. I thought I was going to lose it!	hit:12207_conv:24415_2_842
i understand the dog is being a dog, but the owner does nothing about it even when i tell him about it	hit:12207_conv:24415_3_675
Right, I had to end up calling the homeowners association on them	hit:12207_conv:24415_4_842
My cat somehow figured out how to open the cabinet and stole a bag of treats.	hit:12208_conv:24416_1_473
Wow that is very clever. I would have never thought that could happen.	hit:12208_conv:24416_2_297
Right? I wasn't even mad about it, I was astounded by his ingenuity.	hit:12208_conv:24416_3_473
That is incredible. I wonder what else you can train him to do.	hit:12208_conv:24416_4_297
Well he also taught himself how to use a toilet so who knows!	hit:12208_conv:24416_5_473
I feel like my husband is the sweetest man in the world	hit:12219_conv:24439_1_327
That is great! Hopefully he continues to be	hit:12219_conv:24439_2_524
I think he will. He puts up with me, and sometimes i can be a pill!	hit:12219_conv:24439_3_327
Lol i'm sure you have to put up with him as well so its even	hit:12219_conv:24439_4_524
I was so upset when I had to put my dog down last month	hit:12227_conv:24454_1_259
Oh no. That's so sad. Was she sick for long?	hit:12227_conv:24454_2_557
Not really. She was old and we woke up one day and she could not use her back legs. It was very sad.	hit:12227_conv:24454_3_259
I'm sorry. At least she had a good long life.	hit:12227_conv:24454_4_557
During my first year in grad school, my basement apartment flooded. EVERYTHING was destroyed and I had to start over fresh.	hit:12273_conv:24547_1_791
That is awful! Did you have insurance to cover everything?	hit:12273_conv:24547_2_683
Thankfully, yes!! It took several months to replace everything that I could -- but even things, so many things I just simply couldn't replace. 	hit:12273_conv:24547_3_791
Yeah that is horrible. I am sorry that happened to you. 	hit:12273_conv:24547_4_683
I am in charge of booking meeting rooms for outside companies at my job. Last week, I made a big mistake and accidentally gave a group a room for free when they should've paid $100.	hit:12283_conv:24566_1_791
Oh no! I hope you didn't get into too much trouble by doing so!	hit:12283_conv:24566_2_580
Thankfully, not too much! I was simply mortified because this was one of my main responsibilities and I managed to mess that one up so badly!	hit:12283_conv:24566_3_791
To be fair, everybody makes mistakes and it's bound to happen even to the best of us!	hit:12283_conv:24566_4_580
My brother and his friends invited me to a party tonight.	hit:12283_conv:24567_1_580
Sounds like that could be fun if you like your brother and if you like parties. Do you want to go?	hit:12283_conv:24567_2_791
I just came back from it! I'm actually still a little intoxicated. I must say it was a lot of fun, we celebrated my birthday and I felt very loved and happy.	hit:12283_conv:24567_3_580
Happy Birthday! I'm glad you were able to have fun and be surrounded by those that love you.	hit:12283_conv:24567_4_791
Thank you so very much! I appreciate the sentiment.	hit:12283_conv:24567_5_580
I drank a lot and told my girlfriend that I would definitely sleep with her best friend if she was down to do so.	hit:12286_conv:24573_1_580
What was her reaction to that	hit:12286_conv:24573_2_126
She was a little sad and surprised, but we had been talking about threesomes for a long time now so she understood. Regardless, I felt very ashamed the next day.	hit:12286_conv:24573_3_580
I am sure she will forgive you	hit:12286_conv:24573_4_126
She already has. We both think of these type of things so all is good.	hit:12286_conv:24573_5_580
My husband and I have been watching TV together each night--once the baby is asleep, of course.	hit:12288_conv:24576_1_791
That sounds like some nice relaxing quality time	hit:12288_conv:24576_2_724
It really is! it's the only time in the day that we're guaranteed to have some time together, just us. 	hit:12288_conv:24576_3_791
Have you ever passed out together watching tv?	hit:12288_conv:24576_4_724
Not yet - but I'm sure it'll happen at some point!	hit:12288_conv:24576_5_791
How old is your baby?	hit:12288_conv:24576_6_724
8 months old - but by looking at him, you'd think he was a two-year-old. Thanks for asking!	hit:12288_conv:24576_7_791
And how long have you been married?	hit:12288_conv:24576_8_724

that is exciting! will it be your first house?	hit:12293_conv:24587_2_524
Well it would have been, but someone got a bid in before us and it ended up being sold. My wife was so sad.	hit:12293_conv:24587_3_340
that is no good! hopefully yall will find a better one	hit:12293_conv:24587_4_524
I let my friend watch my dog last weekend.	hit:12295_conv:24590_1_260
You must really trust your friend! How did that turn out?	hit:12295_conv:24590_2_791
It was good, he (the dog) seemed really happy when I got back. He said that he let my dog out a bunch and even took him to the park!	hit:12295_conv:24590_3_260
Good to hear that it went so well. Do you think you'll let your friend watch him again?	hit:12295_conv:24590_4_791
Absolutely. He has proved himself to be trustworthy when it comes to important stuff.	hit:12295_conv:24590_5_260
I once almost ruined my husband's master's thesis presentation--something he needed to pass to get his degree.	hit:12295_conv:24591_1_791
Oh no, what did you do?	hit:12295_conv:24591_2_260
I started coughing--badly. He and everyone else stopped to look at me and make sure I was okay. He was so distracted after that!	hit:12295_conv:24591_3_791
Don't worry, from what you said it doesn't sound like you almost ruined it. It wasn't something on purpose at least.	hit:12295_conv:24591_4_260
I was expecting a surprise birthday party today.	hit:12299_conv:24599_1_580
Lol that makes a lot of sense?	hit:12299_conv:24599_2_525
Yeah I had a few hints. My expectations were somewhat true; my brother's friend celebrated not only my birthday party, but two other birthdays today. It was wonderful!	hit:12299_conv:24599_3_580
well that sounds fun!	hit:12299_conv:24599_4_525
It really was. I was so happy!	hit:12299_conv:24599_5_580
Last week while my wife were out for dinner at a restaurant, I got up to use the restroom and walked by the kitchen. I saw a cook pick up a piece of chicken off the floor and put it back on someone's plate.	hit:12301_conv:24603_1_340
Haha caught red handed!	hit:12301_conv:24603_2_437
We proceeded to leave the restaurant, but not after informing the manager, very loudly, about the incident. 	hit:12301_conv:24603_3_340
Yeah, I wonder what their bathrooms are like if that's their service	hit:12301_conv:24603_4_437
I hope I do well when I start school soon, I can't help but think it will be too hard.	hit:12305_conv:24610_1_260
Don't worry about it you will do fine. Kindergarten isn't too hard. Just don't eat the glue.	hit:12305_conv:24610_2_139
Lmao. It's actually my junior year of mech engineering.	hit:12305_conv:24610_3_260
Oh I see. My mistake. I was wondering how you could type and spell so well for a 6 year old. Well good luck in college!	hit:12305_conv:24610_4_139
Thanks lol. I wish I could type this well at 6 years old.	hit:12305_conv:24610_5_260
My husband's been searching for a professional job but can't seem to land one after interviewing.	hit:12309_conv:24618_1_791
Did he try to get another diploma in this profession area?	hit:12309_conv:24618_2_7
Well, he has a masters degree and graduate certificate already. He's had a fourth interview for a position last Thursday -- so we are hoping this one will finally be the one!	hit:12309_conv:24618_3_791
That is a good news. I hope he get it.	hit:12309_conv:24618_4_7
Last month my son had to have surgery to have his tonsils removed.	hit:12311_conv:24622_1_340
Surgery on my kids always scares me but I have heard that it is best to have them taken out while they are young	hit:12311_conv:24622_2_852
Yeah, I was terrified. I just wandering around the waiting room the entire time till they came and told me everything went fine. Seemed like it took days.	hit:12311_conv:24622_3_340
I understand, when it comes to our kids and being worried about them it feels like time stand still	hit:12311_conv:24622_4_852
Isn't it nice when people bring you food, when you've had a long day?	hit:12312_conv:24625_1_799
Oh for sure. I hate having to cook and do dishes after a long hard day	hit:12312_conv:24625_2_724
Exactly! My boyfriend brought me dinner the other night. I had no groceries and just didn't feel like going out after a long stressful day. I was so thankful.	hit:12312_conv:24625_3_799
Were at work today or doing something else?	hit:12312_conv:24625_4_724
My little sister has been going all across the country this summer, spending lots of time on money on pop concert after pop concert.	hit:12321_conv:24643_1_791
Interesting. How do you feel about it? Do you find it fun and interesting, or wish she were more responsible with her money?	hit:12321_conv:24643_2_273
Mostly I'm a bit frustrated that she's got so much money to blow on these concerts! And to travel all across the country!	hit:12321_conv:24643_3_791
Yeah, I can understand that. Sometimes when you're not in a position to enjoy yourself because you're busy being tied down with responsibilities, it's easy to get mad at others. Whatever you can do to spin it positively, I would suggest that. Being negative about it will only make everyone's lives worse.	hit:12321_conv:24643_4_273
During this past spring during a bad storm, we had a tornado touch down in my neighbors yard.	hit:12326_conv:24652_1_340
Oh my gosh!  That had to be super scary!	hit:12326_conv:24652_2_277
It sounded like a train going by the house from the basement. Thankfully no one was hurt.	hit:12326_conv:24652_3_340
Yeah, thank god you are safe.  I don't know what I would have done if that happened to me.	hit:12326_conv:24652_4_277
I don't like joining it when people talk about someone that's not there, just like what happened yesterday.	hit:12330_conv:24660_1_260
Yep I thinks its disrespectful and petty. What happened? 	hit:12330_conv:24660_2_59
He was talking about my other friend who is a bit annoying sometimes. While I may agree I just don't like talking behind someones back.	hit:12330_conv:24660_3_260
Thats good. I am amazed by people who think its okay to do that. 	hit:12330_conv:24660_4_59
Yeah I feel like not everyone is as moral as me. But that's pretentious which is ironically amoral.	hit:12330_conv:24660_5_260
I work at a library cataloging materials and am often asked to help my coworkers--it makes me feel like an expert, though I'm not.	hit:12338_conv:24676_1_791
Sounds like your co workers respect you then	hit:12338_conv:24676_2_126
They seem to. Or, at least, they know whom is the right person to go to for those specific kinds of questions!	hit:12338_conv:24676_3_791
Or that as well ha	hit:12338_conv:24676_4_126
When I was a young kid, I stole some comic books from the local grocery store.	hit:12345_conv:24690_1_340
Did you ever get caught?	hit:12345_conv:24690_2_524
My mother found out and made me walk them back into the store and give them to the manager. That was a humbling experience.	hit:12345_conv:24690_3_340
Was she disappointed?	hit:12345_conv:24690_4_524
When I went into labor with my son, it was quite the ordeal. He came before he was supposed to.	hit:12350_conv:24701_1_791
How many month earlier he came?	hit:12350_conv:24701_2_7
It was actually only a week--but he wasn't showing signs of being physically ready was the problem. Thankfully, I'd already had my bags packed for weeks so we went to the hospital ready!	hit:12350_conv:24701_3_791
Is he healthy?	hit:12350_conv:24701_4_7
In the end, yes--growing too big is actually his problem now!	hit:12350_conv:24701_5_791
One time I studied all night for my final exam!	hit:12361_conv:24722_1_547

It was for Organic Chemistry	hit:12361_conv:24722_3_547

One of my coworkers has been arguing with his supervisor a LOT lately.	hit:12392_conv:24785_1_791
What are they arguing about?	hit:12392_conv:24785_2_829
Everything and anything. It's annoying, though--he's not getting fired and is, in fact, getting more hours despite arguing all the time!	hit:12392_conv:24785_3_791
That's so ridiculous!	hit:12392_conv:24785_4_829
