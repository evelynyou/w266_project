Thank You. That is our next step we are moving from NYC to Miami after the baby. How can we find friends like yours? 	gratitude	0.8861	admiration	0.0558		
Get involved in something. Church, a social club for interests you are in. I don't recommend parent groups, for some reason they get really nasty. Just find a way to connect with people. Having children is so much harder without a support system!	neutral	0.3145	disapproval	0.1887	annoyance	0.1812

Did you take it back or keep it|I completely agree, having complete control over your diet is amazing and has a ton of benefits|Which one?|True. There has to be a work/school/life balance. |I bet!

I think it might actually be harder to watch our kids go through that kind of loss than to actually go through it ourselves.

We ended up adopting a pup from the shelter that had lost her human mom - it was meant to me - my daughter lost her pup and this pup had lost her mom. It's helped, something to think about at least.	neutral	0.3381	annoyance	0.1135	approval	0.0876

Did you property get broken into? Or your neighbor's property?|I see. Well, it seems as people get older they want to go back to places which reminds them of past.

Yeah, I can understand that. Sometimes when you're not in a position to enjoy yourself because you're busy being tied down with responsibilities, it's easy to get mad at others. Whatever you can do to spin it positively, I would suggest that. Being negative about it will only make everyone's lives worse.	joy	0.3239	approval	0.1261	neutral	0.1019
