I was doing great with [NAME] before I found out about you.	1	Ross_5_2
Hey, I was doin'great before I found out about you. You think it 's easy for me to see you with [NAME]?	1	Rachel_5_3
The point is I...	1	Ross_5_4
I do n't need this right now, OK.	1	Ross_5_5
It, it 's too late, I 'm with somebody else, I 'm happy.	1	Ross_5_6
This ship has sailed.	1	Ross_5_7
Alright, fine, you go ahead and you do that, alright [NAME].	1	Rachel_5_8

Hi [NAME]!	4	Mrs. Green_7_9
Hi roomie!	4	Ross_7_10
Hey! What did you decide to do about the movie?	0	Monica_8_0
I don't know!	0	Joey_8_1
It's not like it's porn!	0	Joey_8_2
This is a serious, legitimate movie.	0	Joey_8_3
And the nudity is really important to the story.	0	Joey_8_4
That's what you say about porn.	0	Monica_8_5
You're right. Maybe I shouldn't even go on the call back.	0	Joey_8_6
No! No you should! A lot of major actors do nude scenes! I mean, the chance to star in a movie? Come on!	4	Monica_8_7
Well that's true.	0	Joey_8_8
And I am only naked in one scene.	0	Joey_8_9

My character's catholic and he falls in love with this Jewish girl.	0	Joey_8_11
Who run away together and they get caught in this big rainstorm.	0	Joey_8_12
So we go into this barn and undress each other and hold each other.	0	Joey_8_13

`` Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly. '' Nice!	4	Chandler_9_3

Someone I can learn from, someone-someone who's different than me.	0	Joey_9_6
And what's more different than me. A guy who's	0	Joey_9_7
So where are we going next?	0	Ross_10_0
This witness wo n't return my calls so we 're gon na see if we can surprise him coming home.	0	Gary_10_1
Sur-surprise him? We 're not, we 're not gon na make anybody mad are we?	3	Chandler_10_2
Come on man! Listen so uh, are you gon na squeeze the perps shoes a little bit before he lawyers up?	4	Joey_10_3

Nooo! Nooooo! You lent me [NAME] 's earrings?! I 'm not allowed to borrow her stuff!	1	Rachel_11_10

Ooh! [NAME]! Okay!	3	Joey_15_9
Well, I went over to Kyle's last night to pick up a few things and we got to reminiscing	0	Whitney_16_0
we talked through most of the night and we realized that the reason we were so angry at each other was because there are still feelings there. So	5	Kyle_16_1
Oh just say it [NAME]!	6	Ross_16_2
We're gon na give it another try.	4	Kyle_16_3
What about her whining and her constant need for attention?!	1	Phoebe_16_4

Oh. Y'know, he hums while he does other stuff to.	0	Phoebe_16_15
Yeah, we 're better off without them.	1	Ross_16_16
And y'know, even if they break up again, you'd better not let him in your sad men's club!	1	Phoebe_16_17
Divorced men's club.	5	Ross_16_18
Why isn't that valet back with my [NAME]?	1	Joey_17_0
Maybe because you've got the keys?	1	Passerby_17_1
This is totally your fault!	1	Rachel_17_2
My fault?! You threatened the judge!	1	Ross_17_3

[NAME]!	0	Monica_18_0

I know!	3	Monica_18_5
How bad is this?	3	Monica_18_6
Well for the regular guy, it's bad, but [NAME], Oh dear God!	3	Phoebe_18_7

What are you gon na do?	0	Phoebe_18_9
Well, I'm never gon na listen to you again, that's for sure!	1	Monica_18_10
`` Y'know, harm can it do if you go and put your name down? ''	0	Monica_18_11
[NAME] said that!	6	Phoebe_18_12
Well Rachel's not here!	1	Monica_18_13
Come on, come on.	0	Ross_19_0
Damnit, damnit, damnit, damnit.	1	Ross_19_1
This is all your fault.	1	Ross_19_2
This is supposed to be, like, the greatest day of my life, y'know?	1	Ross_19_3
My son is being born, and I should be in there, you know, instead of stuck in a closet with you.	1	Ross_19_4
The woman I love is having a baby today. I 've been waiting for this just as much as you have.	1	Susan_19_5
No no no, believe me.	1	Ross_19_6
No one has been waiting for this as much as I have, ok?	1	Ross_19_7
And you know what the funny thing is?	0	Ross_19_8
When this day is over, you get to go home with the baby, ok?	1	Ross_19_9
Where does that leave me?	5	Ross_19_10
You get to be the baby 's father.	0	Susan_19_11
Everyone knows who you are.	0	Susan_19_12
Who am I?	1	Susan_19_13
There 's Mother 's [NAME], there 's Father 's [NAME], there 's no... Lesbian Lover [NAME].	5	Susan_19_14
Every day is Lesbian Lover [NAME].	0	Ross_19_15
This is so great.	4	Phoebe_19_16
You wan na explain that?	0	Ross_19_17
I mean, well, 'cause when I was growing up, you know my dad left, and my mother died, and my stepfather went to jail, so I barely had enough pieces of parents to make one whole one.	5	Phoebe_19_18
And here 's this little baby who has like three whole parents who care about it so much that they 're fighting over who gets to love it the most.	4	Phoebe_19_19
And it 's not even born yet.	5	Phoebe_19_20
It 's just, it 's just the luckiest baby in the whole world.	4	Phoebe_19_21
I 'm sorry, you were fighting.	5	Phoebe_19_22
Okay, it 's a typical New [NAME] City apartment. Two girls are just hanging out.	0	Joey_20_0
Hi, how are you doing [NAME]?	0	Monica_20_1
I 'm doing just fine! God, [NAME], you smell so great!	4	Rachel_20_2
It 's my new perfume. Why do n't you come closer where you can	0	Monica_20_3
Oh, y'know [NAME], you are sick!	2	Rachel_20_4
This is disgusting!	2	Monica_20_5
I 'm not reading this!	2	Rachel_20_6
What?! Wait-wait-wait! The handsome man was about to enter!!	6	Joey_20_7
All right, I 'll give you this, Mr. Peanut is a better dresser.	0	Joey_21_0
I mean he 's got the monocle, he 's got the top hat...	0	Joey_21_1

[NAME] louder, okay, I think there 's a man on the twelfth floor in a coma that did n't quite hear you...	1	Ross_22_6
Then what?	0	Chandler_22_7
My first time with [NAME] was...	0	Ross_22_8

With [NAME]? Oh.	6	Joey_22_11
So in your whole life, you 've only been with oneoh.	6	Chandler_22_12
Whoah, boy, hockey was a big mistake! There was a whole bunch of stuff we could 've done tonight!	6	Joey_22_13
Hi. Where is everybody?	0	Ross_23_0
Oh, it's already closed, [NAME] gave me the keys to lock up-what is wrong?	5	Phoebe_23_1
My marriage, I think my marriage is um, is kinda over.	5	Ross_23_2
Oh no! Why?	6	Phoebe_23_3
Cause Carol's a lesbian. And, and I'm not one. And apparently it's not a mix and match situation.	5	Ross_23_4
Oh my God! I don't believe it! Oh, you poor bunny.	6	Phoebe_23_5
I'm an idiot.	2	Ross_23_6
I mean shoulda seen it, I mean [NAME] and I'd be out and she'd, she'd see some beautiful woman, and, and she'd be [NAME] y'know look at her, and I'd think, God, my wife is cool!	5	Ross_23_7
Aw! Hey, do you think that [NAME] person is her lover?	0	Phoebe_23_8
Well, now I do!!	6	Ross_23_9
I'm sorry.	5	Phoebe_23_10
Seven years.	5	Ross_23_11
I mean we've been together seven years, she's the only woman who's ever loved me, and the only woman I've-I've ever....	5	Ross_23_12
Aw, God [NAME]. Oh.	5	Phoebe_23_13
I'll do it.	0	Cookie_24_0
No you won't.	0	Joey_24_1
Look he knows he did a terrible thing and I believe him, he's sorry.	5	Joey_24_2
But, you've got one more apology to make, all right, you've got to apologize to Mary-Angela.	0	Joey_24_3
Okay, absolutely!	4	Chandler_24_4
All right.	0	Joey_24_5
You've got it.	0	Chandler_24_6
Cookie, now you can punch him!	1	Joey_24_7
What?!	6	Chandler_24_8
All right, that 's it, I quit.	1	Phoebe_25_0
What? I did n't say anything.	6	Monica_25_1
Yeah, but this is n't the face of a person who trusts a person.	1	Phoebe_25_2
Ok, this is the face of a person who, you know, does n't trust a person.	1	Phoebe_25_3
I 'm sorry. I 'm sorry, [NAME]. It 's just a little shorter than what we had discussed.	5	Monica_25_4
Would you relax? I know what I am doing. This is how he wears it.	1	Phoebe_25_5
[NAME].	0	Monica_26_0
What?!	6	Rachel_26_1
[NAME]!	6	Monica_26_2
You were with [NAME]?	0	Rachel_26_3
Look, when it started I was just trying to be nice to her because she was my brother 's girlfriend.	0	Monica_26_4
And then, one thing led to another and, before I knew it, we were... shopping.	0	Monica_26_5
Oh. Oh my God.	6	Rachel_26_6
Honey, wait. We only did it once. It did n't mean anything to me.	5	Monica_26_7
Yeah, right. Sure!	1	Rachel_26_8
Really, [NAME], I was thinking of you the whole time.	5	Monica_26_9
Look, I 'm sorry, all right.	5	Monica_26_10
I never meant for you to find out!	5	Monica_26_11
Oh, please, you wanted to get caught.	1	Rachel_26_12
That is not true!	1	Monica_26_13
Oh, so you just sort of happened to leave it in here?	1	Rachel_26_14
Did it ever occur to you that I might just be that stupid?	1	Monica_26_15
Ok, [NAME]. I just have to know one thing. Did you go with her to	5	Rachel_26_16

We were n't but we had one class together. He was such a great guy and he talked so passionately about science. I always remembered him.	5	Kori_31_2
I 'm sure that would mean a lot to him.	0	Chandler_31_3
And if heaven has a door, I 'm sure he 's pressing his ear up against it and listening intently.	0	Chandler_31_4
I thought so many times about calling him and asking him out. I guess I really missed my chance.	5	Kori_31_5
But you did n't!	4	Ross_31_6
I 'm still alive!!	4	Ross_31_7
[NAME], I know this is a big surprise for you.	4	Ross_31_8
It 's a long story but the things you just said really made my day!	4	Ross_31_9
I mean, the fact that you are here means more to me than if this room were filled with people!	4	Ross_31_10
You sick freak, who does that? I ca n't believe I had a crush on you!	1	Kori_31_11
Did you hear that? [NAME] had a crush on me!!	4	Ross_31_12
We'll do a quick check.	0	Dr. Long_32_0
Okay.	0	Rachel_32_1
So, eight days late huh?	6	Dr. Long_32_2
Yeah.	0	Rachel_32_3
You must be a little uncomfortable.	0	Dr. Long_32_4
Eh, just a tad.	0	Rachel_32_5
You're about 80 percent effaced, so you're on your way.	0	Dr. Long_32_6
It still could last a little while longer.	0	Dr. Long_32_7
If you're anxious there are a few ways to help things along.	0	Dr. Long_32_8
Do them!!	1	Ross_32_9
Actually, they're things you can do. Just some home remedies, but in my experience I've found that some of them are quite effective.	0	Dr. Long_32_10
Well, we are ready to try anything.	0	Rachel_32_11
Okay, there's an herbal tea you can drink.	0	Dr. Long_32_12
Okay.	0	Rachel_32_13
What is wrong with [NAME]?	5	Chandler_33_0
Oh she misunderstood, she thought she was moving to Tulsa.	0	Monica_33_1
Anytime you 're ready.	0	Carol_34_0
Ok, ok, here we go.	0	Ross_34_1
Ok, where am I talking to, here?	0	Ross_34_2
I mean, uh, well, there is one way that seems to offer a certain acoustical advantage, but...	0	Ross_34_3
Just aim for the bump.	0	Carol_34_4
Ok, ok, ok, ok, here goes.	0	Ross_34_5
You know, I, you know, ca n't do this.	3	Ross_34_6
Uh, this is too weird.	2	Ross_34_7
I feel stupid.	5	Ross_34_8
So do n't do it, it 's fine. You do n't have to do it just because [NAME] does it.	0	Carol_34_9
Hello, baby. Hello, hello.	4	Ross_34_10
Oh, hi. It's [NAME].	0	Mark_35_0
Easy. Easy. You have to go to the hospital. Okay?	3	Ross_36_0
Okay, I do.	0	Rachel_36_1
Okay.	0	Ross_36_2
I really do.	0	Rachel_36_3
Okay, I'm gon na get your coat and then I'll-I'll put you in a cab.	0	Ross_36_4
Okay. Oh wait, wait-wait, you're not gon na come with me?	5	Rachel_36_5
Of course I am. I just have to make a call.	6	Ross_36_6
Okay.	0	Rachel_36_7

Thank you. Oww!!!! God!	6	Rachel_36_9
What?! I wh-, what's wrong?	3	Ross_36_10
I'm sorry, I just can't go to the hospital lookin' like this.	2	Rachel_36_11
[NAME] is circling the ring now. It looks like, he's just trying to feel him out. Oh, Bruiser is just...	0	TV Announcer_37_0
Run! Run you crazy, rich freak!	3	Chandler_37_1
Oh, I can't watch this.	3	Rachel_37_2
Check it out, he's winning! Pete's winning!	6	Joey_37_3
Really?!	6	Monica_37_4
No-o-o!!	3	Joey_37_5
Uh-oh, Bruiser has [NAME] on the canvas and is going for his favourite area.	3	TV Announcer_37_6
Oh! Oh!	2	All_37_7
Wait, if that's his favourite area, why is he being so mean to it?	6	Phoebe_37_8
Well, this is ironic.	6	Ross_37_9
Of your last two boyfriends, [NAME] didn't want to have kids, and from the looks of it, now [NAME] can't.	0	Ross_37_10
Dude, you don't have to brag! We got nothing here!!	1	Joey_38_0
Should we tell [NAME] there's an empty private room right next door to hers?	0	Chandler_39_0
We could, or we can have sex in it.	4	Monica_39_1
Well let me think about that, while I remove my pants!	4	Chandler_39_2
I thought I was a complete idiot.	6	Rachel_40_0
Hey, I'm with you. He even asked me if I thought you'd go out with him.	0	Joey_40_1
Oh! Oh, I think I'm gon na throw up a little bit. What did you say?	2	Rachel_40_2
I said no.	0	Joey_40_3
What?!	6	Rachel_40_4
What? I I just figured since you're pregnant you're not gon na be seeing people.	6	Joey_40_5
Okay [NAME], first of all [NAME] is not people. Second of all, what did he say when you told him I was pregnant?	1	Rachel_40_6
I didn't tell him. I didn't know if you were telling people. This is back when I thought [NAME] was still people.	0	Joey_40_7
Good-good, don't tell him. Don't tell him. Just have him call me okay?	3	Rachel_40_8
Rach look, I really don't think that's such a great	5	Joey_40_9
Okay, you go do it! I'll come back to that set! I'll meet more actors! I'll meet em all!	4	Rachel_40_10
Ohh, here you are. I was looking for you before. Joshua's gone so you and [NAME] are free to go.	0	Rachel_41_0
That's okay.	0	Ross_41_1
She's still in there enjoying her fake party and uh, it's too late to do any of the things I had planned, so	0	Ross_41_2
[NAME]! [NAME]! I forgot my jacket!	1	Ross_42_0
You tell them to wait!	1	Ross_42_1
Okay. Wait! Wait!	0	Rachel_42_2

No, I-I actually thought it was unfair the way everyone reacted. I mean you had just moved in.	0	The Hot Girl_44_2
Jen.	0	The Hot Girl_44_3
Jen, I know this may sound a little But uh, would you maybe wan na grab a cup of coffee sometime, or	0	Ross_44_4

Okay.	0	Rachel_45_2
Ow!	6	Monica_45_3
Aren't you gon na go?	0	Phoebe_45_4
No. Thank you.	0	Rachel_45_5
No, [NAME] never pees in public restrooms.	0	Monica_45_6
Well, they never have any paper in there y'know. So my rule is no tissue, no tuschy.' Well, if everybody's going.	0	Rachel_45_7

Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no!!	3	Chandler_45_9

My lighter's in there!	3	Chandler_45_11

Although, don't feel like you can't visit.	0	Phoebe_46_1
Hey, is, is, is [NAME] here?	0	Joey_46_2
No, no he's not.	0	Ross_46_3
You guys, [NAME] just saw [NAME] kissing her ex-husband.	6	Monica_46_4
What? So what are you going to do? I mean how, how are you going to tell [NAME]?	6	Ross_46_5
Well, I was thinking about that and I, I think the best way would be, to not.	0	Joey_46_6
[NAME], you can't keep this to yourself, if you know about this, you have to tell him.	0	Rachel_46_7
It'll kill him. I mean it'll, it'll just kill him.	3	Joey_46_8
Well, you could wait til I go to the dentist, maybe	0	Phoebe_46_9
Hey, what are you doing here?	0	Carol_47_0
Well, oh just ah, I was just wondering, when you and I split up, did you get the tape that was half the last episode of	0	Ross_47_1

How, how is this my fault?	6	Susan_49_1
Look, [NAME] never threw me out of a room before you came along.	1	Ross_49_2
Yeah? Well, there 's a lot of things [NAME] never did before I came along.	1	Susan_49_3
Hey, hey, ok, all right, that 's it!	1	Phoebe_49_6
Get in here.	1	Phoebe_49_7
Come on.	0	Phoebe_49_8
My god, you guys, I do n't believe you.	1	Phoebe_49_9
There are children coming into the world in this very building and your negative fighting noises are not the first thing they should be hearing.	1	Phoebe_49_10
So just stop all the yelling, just stop it!	1	Phoebe_49_11
Yeah, [NAME].	0	Ross_49_12

Okay, maybe ask this guy.	0	Phoebe_50_3
Oh, did I not mention? [NAME] is a guy I hired to be my identical twin for a medical research project.	0	Joey_51_0
Y'know sometimes the good ideas are just right in front of you, aren't they?	4	Chandler_51_1
Okay, I know it sounds crazy, but I think it might work. Y'know? The only problem is, Carl's acting is	0	Joey_51_2

Alright. [NAME]?	0	Monica_54_0
Okay, okay.	0	Phoebe_54_1

Yeah, see.. you took mine. [NAME], what about you?	0	Ross_54_3
Uh, if I were omnipotent for a day, I'd.. make myself omnipotent forever.	0	Chandler_54_4

And so I'm gon na get on this spaceship, and I'm gon na go to Blargon 7 in search of alternative fuels.	5	Joey_56_12
But when I return, 200 years from now, you'll be long gone.	5	Joey_56_13
But I won't have aged at all.	0	Joey_56_14

Hi [NAME]!	4	Phoebe_57_3
Hey Mon!	4	Ross_57_4
Hey Mon!	4	Rachel_57_5
Oh my God, has she slept at all?	6	Phoebe_57_6
Nope.	0	Ross_57_7
No, it 's been three nights in a row.	0	Rachel_57_8
Yeah, she finally stopped crying yesterday, but then she found one of [NAME] 's cigar butts out on the terrace, so.	0	Ross_57_9
Oh, okay that explains it.	0	Phoebe_57_10
I got a call at two in the morning, but all I could hear was, like, this high squeaky sound, so I thought okay its like a mouse or a opossum.	0	Phoebe_57_11
But then I realized where would a mouse or a opossum get the money to make the phone call.	4	Phoebe_57_12
So uh, man, are you gon na go to the play with me tonight?	0	Chandler_58_0
Y'know what, I don't know how comfortable I am going to see how hot the sex is between some guy and your girlfriend.	2	Ross_58_1
Yeah, I know but	0	Chandler_58_2
Oh no-no-no, I'm there.	0	Ross_58_3

Oh yeah!	4	Ross_58_11
Yes, if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches.	0	Chandler_59_0
Yeah, hero sandwiches.	0	Joey_59_1
Well you all know that I 'm a pacifist so I 'm not interested in war in any way.	0	Phoebe_59_2
When the revolution comes, I will have to destroy you all.	0	Phoebe_59_3
Not you [NAME].	0	Phoebe_59_4
Oh my good God.	6	Chandler_60_0
Hey! Continuing the countdown of your favorite meals. Tonight, No. 3, macaroni and cheese with cut up hot dogs.	0	Monica_60_1
Look, you have done enough! Okay? You have to stop this now.	1	Chandler_60_2
I will! But not tonight. For dinner music, I thought we could listen to that tape you made me.	4	Monica_60_3
Oh, the mixed tape.	0	Chandler_60_4
The Way You Look Tonight	4	Monica_60_5
You are just the sweetest.	4	Monica_60_6
Hey!	4	Monica_61_0
Hey!	4	Phoebe_61_1
Hey, guess what I'm doing tonight.	0	Monica_61_2

Ohh, [NAME], I am so excited for you.	4	Phoebe_61_5
So honey this uh, this threesome thing umm, I mean how-how are you gon na start to find	0	Ross_62_0

Oh, I know. Y'know, just-just talking about it is getting me kinda	0	Ross_62_4
Oh, me too.	0	Carol_62_5
and then, we could've gone from the ceremony to the reception with you in the sidecar!	4	Ross_63_0
[NAME], it just wouldn't have been feasible.	0	Rachel_63_1
But having a dove place the ring on your finger would've been no problem?	1	Ross_63_2
It was really fun being married to you tonight.	4	Rachel_63_3
Yeah! And! And, it was the easiest 400 bucks I've ever made.	4	Ross_63_4
Okay [NAME], can I uh, can I ask you something?	5	Rachel_63_5
Yeah.	0	Ross_63_6
That proposal, at the planetarium	0	Rachel_63_7
I know, I know it was stupid.	5	Ross_63_8
Are you kidding?!	6	Rachel_63_9
With the, with the lilies, and-and the song, and the stars!	4	Rachel_63_10
It was really wonderful!	4	Rachel_63_11
Did you just make that up?	6	Rachel_63_12
No, actually I thought about it when, when we were going out.	0	Ross_63_13
It's how I imagined I uh, I would ask you to marry me.	0	Ross_63_14
Well, that would've been very hard to say no too.	0	Rachel_63_15
It's a good thing I didn't do it, because it sounds like it would've been a very expensive wedding. Okay, good night	0	Ross_63_16
Goodnight	0	Rachel_63_17
Even if the sidecar had a windscreen so your hair wouldn't get messed up?	0	Ross_63_18
I will think about it.	0	Rachel_63_19
That's all I'm askin'	0	Ross_63_20
You guys! It was bananas, cream, and beef! I-I just can not believe that you ate that so that I wouldn't feel bad!	6	Rachel_64_0
Well actually, I-I didn't eat mine. It's still in the bathroom.	4	Monica_64_1
No it isn't, I ate that.	0	Joey_64_2
Well we left ours in Monica's bedroom.	0	Mrs. Geller_64_3
Nope, got it and I got yours too.	0	Joey_64_4
And that's I'm so glad there's no problem.	4	Rachel_65_0
That's fine, actually I'm on the hiring committee, so there'll be at least one friendly face.	0	Joanna_65_1
Ohh! That's great!	4	Rachel_65_2
You know, [NAME] Miss is where I started. Oh, I had to sleep with the	0	Joanna_65_3

No-ho-ho!	4	Joanna_65_5
Yeah.	0	Joanna_65_6
I mean, no-no-no-no-no, don't you worry, I'm sure with your qualifications you won't need to sleep with some guy to get that job.	0	Joanna_65_7
Although, I might need some convincing.	0	Joanna_65_8
Well, I, umm	3	Rachel_65_9
Kidding! God, I feel wild today!	4	Joanna_65_10
Oh my God! [NAME] just left though!	6	Phoebe_66_0
Yeah but, maybe it's not what we think. Maybe it's tell [NAME] I'm sorry I drank the last of the milk.	0	Rachel_66_1
Or maybe he-he was writing to tell her that-that he's changed his name, y'know? Tell [NAME] I'm sorry.	0	Phoebe_66_2
I think it means he freaked out and left!	6	Ross_66_3
Don't be so negative! [NAME] God! Isn't it possible that Sorry is sitting in there right now?!	1	Phoebe_66_4
Okay. [NAME], I-I think [NAME] is right. What are we gon na do?	5	Rachel_66_5
LookOkay, I'm just gon na I'm gon na have to go find him and bring him back!	0	Ross_66_6
Okay?	0	Ross_66_7

What's the charity?	0	Monica_67_6
I don't know, something either trees or diseaseRalph mumbles a lot.	0	Rachel_67_7
Does [NAME] mumble when you're not paying attention?	0	Monica_67_8
Yeah! It's weird. But the thing is need to find a date.	6	Rachel_67_9
Well, what kind of guy are you looking for?	0	Phoebe_67_10
Hey!	4	Rachel_68_0

I just found out that Elizabeth's dad wants to meet me.	5	Ross_68_5
Wait a minute, hold the phone! You're not Elizabeth's dad?!	6	Chandler_68_6
Come on guys, I-I really want this guy to like me.	3	Ross_68_7

Okay?	0	Ross_77_11
And then apart, and then together, and then apart, and now we have a baby.	5	Ross_77_12
It's just if-if we got together again and it didn't work out I could never do that to [NAME].	5	Ross_77_13
I mean she-she thinking everything Oh that's now me.	5	Ross_77_14

At his apartment. Is this juice?	0	Rachel_90_4
Whoa, whoa. And the fact that you dumped him because he hit on [NAME]?	1	Joey_90_5
Oh God, I know I 'm a pathetic loser.	5	Rachel_90_6
I licked my arm, what?	6	Phoebe_91_0
It 's breast milk.	0	Ross_91_1
So?	0	Phoebe_91_2
[NAME], that is juice, squeezed from a person.	0	Rachel_91_3
What is the big deal?	1	Joey_91_4
What did you just do?	6	Chandler_91_5
Ok, would people stop drinking the breast milk?	2	Ross_91_6
You wo n't even taste it?	0	Phoebe_91_7
No!	2	Ross_91_8
Not even if you just pretend that it 's milk?	0	Phoebe_91_9
Not even if [NAME] 's breast had a picture of a missing child on it.	2	Ross_91_10
Aww!	6	All_92_0
Hey Pheebs, could you please not put your feet up on my new old sheet?	2	Ross_92_1

Oh my God, [NAME],	1	Rachel_92_8
Wow! Oh my God, well if they've ripped off our table ours must be much more than one and fifty dollars!	1	Phoebe_92_9
Well this doesn't even smell like opium.	2	Phoebe_92_10
Of course not, it smells like wine, which you spilled! And thanks for wrecking my sheet by the way.	1	Ross_92_11
How is she?	5	Rachel_93_0
It 's too soon to tell. She 's resting, which is a good sign.	0	Phoebe_93_1
How 's the hair?	0	Ross_93_2
I 'm not gon na lie to you, [NAME], it does n't look good.	5	Phoebe_93_3
I put a clip on one side, which seems to have stopped the curling.	0	Phoebe_93_4
Can we see her?	0	Joey_93_5
Your hair looks too good, I think it would upset her. [NAME], why do n't you come on in.	5	Phoebe_93_6
How 're you doing?	5	Joey_93_7
Of course the packaging does appeal to grown-ups and kids alike.	0	Chandler_94_0
[NAME], you 're being silly. I 've tried it, it 's no big deal. Just taste it.	4	Carol_94_1
That would be no.	2	Ross_94_2
Come on. It does n't taste bad.	0	Phoebe_94_3
Yeah, it 's kinda sweet, sorta like, uh...	0	Joey_94_4
Cantaloupe juice.	4	Susan_94_5
Exactly.	0	Joey_94_6
You 've tasted it? You 've tasted it.	6	Ross_94_7
Uh huh.	0	Susan_94_8
Oh, you 've tasted it.	1	Ross_94_9
You can keep saying it, but it wo n't stop being true.	0	Susan_94_10
Gim me the bottle. Gim me the towel.	1	Ross_94_11
I still do n't get why [NAME] and [NAME] would give us a fake number.	1	Monica_95_0
Y'know, if they knew what they were doing they probably didn't give you real names either.	0	Joey_95_1
Okay, maybe people give out fake numbers, but they don't give out fake names.	1	Monica_95_2
Oh yeah? Hi, [NAME], nice to meet you.	0	Joey_95_3
[NAME] Philange.	0	Phoebe_95_4

I thought you said those jokes were funny. Joke! Joke! Joke!	6	Chandler_95_7
Joke. Joke. Blah! Blah!	1	Monica_95_8
Well maybe it was all of your questions.	0	Chandler_95_9
What about my questions?	0	Monica_95_10
No, I'm sorry. It's just my foot itches like crazy.	0	Cliff_96_0
Oh, I'll get it.	0	Phoebe_96_1
Wow! I usually get to know a girl a little better before I let her spoon me.	6	Cliff_96_2
Relax, it's not like we're forking.	4	Phoebe_96_3
Look at it! Ohhh! Wallpaper's a little faded, that's okay. Carpet's a little loose. Hardwood floors!!	4	Monica_97_0

Okay.	0	Monica_97_6
I brought a bunch of stuff for the house, so check it out. Ha-ha.	4	Phoebe_97_7
What's this?	6	Monica_97_8
That's a dog, every house should have a dog.	4	Phoebe_97_9
Not one that can pee on the roof.	6	Monica_97_10
Well, maybe it's so big because the house was built on radioactive waste.	4	Phoebe_97_11
And is this in case the house sneezes?	6	Chandler_97_12
No, no, that's the ghost for the attic.	0	Phoebe_97_13
I don't want a ghost.	3	Monica_97_14
Well, nobody wants a ghost. But you've got one, because the house is sitting on an ancient Indian burial ground.	0	Phoebe_97_15
Wait a minute, the house was built on radioactive waste, and an ancient Indian burial ground? That would never happen.	6	Ross_97_16
Okay, obviously you don't know much about the U.S. government.	0	Phoebe_97_17

Yeah.	0	Frank_108_14
I guess I set up the video camera to try and entice [NAME].	0	Monica_109_0
But sadly I could not be enticed.	4	Joey_109_1
Unbelievable! I mean you really kept [NAME] 's underwear?! Why? Why would you do that?!	2	Ross_109_2
I 'm [NAME]. I 'm disgusting. I stalk guys and keep their underpants.	5	Monica_109_3
Well, I think we 've all learned something about who 's disgusting and who 's not.	1	Joey_109_4
Eh?	0	Joey_109_5
All right, now, I 'm going to get back to my bucket.	0	Joey_109_6
I 'm only eating the skin, so the chicken 's up for grabs.	0	Joey_109_7
Ohh, okay, they gave you the old time pricing.	0	Phoebe_110_0

Yes! That I know, this is from [NAME] Plains.	4	Rachel_110_8
[NAME] Plains. Oh, it sounds like such a magical place.	4	Phoebe_110_9
So, you still don't think I'm boyfriend material?	1	Chandler_111_0
Huh?	0	Monica_111_1
I saw you checking me out during the game last night.	0	Chandler_111_2

Good-bye [NAME] and [NAME]. I'll miss you. P.S. Your Mom lives in Montauk. You just wrote this!	5	Phoebe_112_1
Well, it's pretty much the gist. Well, except for the poem. You read the poem, right?	0	Ursula_112_2
Noooo!!	5	Phoebe_112_3

I know!	5	Monica_113_13
Why do all you're coffee mugs have numbers on the bottom?	6	Mark_0_0
Oh. That's so [NAME] can keep track. That way if one on them is missing, she can be like, Where's number 27?! '	1	Rachel_0_1
Y'know what?	0	Rachel_0_2
Come on, [NAME], you can do it.	0	Joey_1_0
Push!	4	Joey_1_1

So uh, what are you in for?	0	Chandler_5_5
I talk in my sleep.	0	Marjorie_5_6
What a coincidence, I listen in my sleep.	0	Chandler_5_7
So why don't you give me your number?	0	Joey_5_8
Previously on Friends.	0	Joey_6_0
I don't know exactly. It's-it's sorta like wrestling.	0	Monica_6_1
Oh?!	6	Phoebe_6_2
Yeah, but without the costumes.	0	Monica_7_0
Oh.	0	Phoebe_7_1
And it's not fake, it's totally brutal.	0	Joey_7_2
Yeah, it's two guys in a ring, and the rules are : They're	0	Chandler_7_3
So you can like, bite, and pull people's hair and stuff?	6	Monica_7_4
Yeah, anything goes, except ah, eye gouging and fish hooking.	0	Ross_7_5
What's fish hooking?	6	Monica_7_6
Huh, what's fish hooking... Thanks man, that would have been really hard to describe. What is that taste?	0	Ross_7_7
What? My hands are totally clean, I just gave the duck a bath.	0	Joey_7_8
Oh, [NAME], he was nothing compared to you. I had to bite my lip to keep from screaming your name.	5	Jade_8_0
Well, that makes me feel so good.	4	Chandler_8_1
It was just so awkward and bumpy.	0	Jade_8_2
Bumpy?	6	Ross_8_3
Well, maybe he had some kind of uh, new, cool style, that you 're not familiar with.	0	Chandler_8_4
And uh maybe you have to get used to it.	0	Chandler_8_5
Well there really was n't much time to get used to it, you know what I mean?	4	Jade_8_6
Coming through! Oh! Coming through! Oh! Hello! Hi! No! Right! Coming through!	3	Phoebe_9_0
Oh well, it's not so bad.	0	Monica_9_1
Yeah, most of the damage is pretty mostly contained in the bedrooms.	5	Fireman #1_9_2
Oh!	6	Phoebe_9_3
My God!	6	Rachel_9_4
Hey buddy, do you think I can borrow your uniform this Thursday?	0	Joey_9_5
Excuse me?	6	Fireman #1_9_6
[NAME]! He's working! You would look	1	Monica_9_7
Oh, how bad is it?	5	Joey_9_8
Oh, it's bad. It's really bad. The only thing in there that isn't burned is an ass. Which I do	5	Phoebe_9_9
How's your room Rach?	0	Chandler_9_10
Everything's ruined. My bed. My clothes. Look at my favorite blue sweater.	5	Rachel_9_11
Isn't that mine?	0	Monica_9_12
Fine! I'm sorry for your loss!	1	Rachel_9_13
So uh, you're not gon na be able to live here for a while, you ladies have a place to stay?	0	Fireman #1_9_14
Wow! Oh-okay, look pal, I am	4	Rachel_9_15
Yes, they can stay with us.	0	Monica_9_16
Have you figured out what started the fire Mr. Fireman?	0	Chandler_9_17
There's just so much pressure.	1	Joey_10_0
I mean no offense, but what you guys do is very different.	0	Joey_10_1
I don't know if you'd understand.	0	Joey_10_2
Yeah, none of us have to deal with pressure at our jobs.	0	Ross_10_3
Well [NAME], we got ta do something!	5	Rachel_11_0
I mean there's no way Joey's gon na make it in time.	3	Rachel_11_1
So I'm gon na go through the hotel and see if there's any other weddings going on.	0	Rachel_11_2
Okay. Oh but don't tell them Monica's pregnant because they frown on that.	0	Phoebe_11_3
Okay.	0	Rachel_11_4
What's all this about you guys fighting?! Is this really over a room?! I mean, that is so silly!	1	Ross_12_0
[NAME], we can handle this.	0	Monica_12_1
Well, apparently not, and I can't just stand by and watch two people I care about very much be hurt over something that is so silly.	5	Ross_12_2
I mean, enough of the silliness!	1	Ross_12_3
Well, why don't you tell her to stop being silly!	1	Chandler_12_4
Okay-okay!	1	Ross_12_5
Two very good points, look I've known you both a long time, and I've never seen either of you one/millionth as happy as you've been since you've got together.	5	Ross_12_6
Do you really want to throw that all away over a room?	5	Ross_12_7
That is so silly.	4	Ross_12_8
Now wh-what is more important, love or silliness?	0	Ross_12_9
Well, we are fond of the silliness, but we also have a soft spot for the love.	0	Chandler_12_10
[NAME] is the best medicine.	4	Monica_12_11
That's laughter.	4	Chandler_12_12
Why do you do it?	0	Monica_12_13
I don't know.	0	Chandler_12_14
Okay! All right! Now, [NAME] you-you wan na live with [NAME], right?	0	Ross_12_15

Oh.	0	Roger_13_0
But I do n't. Me, [NAME].	0	Phoebe_13_1
Well, I 'm not I 'm not at all surprised they feel that way.	0	Roger_13_2
You 're not? See, that 's why you 're so great!	6	Phoebe_13_3
Actually it 's, it 's quite, y'know, typical behaviour when you have this kind of dysfunctional group dynamic.	0	Roger_13_4
Y'know, this kind of co-dependant, emotionally stunted, sitting in your stupid coffee house with your stupid big cups which, I 'm sorry, might as well have nipples on them, and you 're like all 'Oh, define me!	1	Roger_13_5
Define me!	1	Roger_13_6
[NAME] me, I need love!	1	Roger_13_7
Have you really done this before?	6	Phoebe_14_0
Yeah!	4	Joey_14_1

You just take a big, big swing.	0	Joey_14_4
Now, don't hold back.	0	Joey_14_5
Hey!	4	Phoebe_14_6
Hey-hey-hey!	4	Joey_14_7

We're just celebrating that [NAME] got his health insurance back.	4	Phoebe_14_9
Oh, all right.	0	Chandler_14_10
Yeah! Sure! Yep! Oh, y'know what? If I heard a shot right now, I 'd throw my body on you.	4	Phoebe_15_0
Oh yeah? Well maybe you and I should take a walk through a bad neighborhood.	4	Gary_15_1
Okay!	4	Phoebe_15_2
Bye!	0	Phoebe_15_3
Bye!	0	Joey_15_4
Cut it out [NAME]! I hate to have to save your life and kick your ass in the same day!	1	Joey_15_5
Hey, [NAME], could you pass the cheese?	0	Monica_16_0
Listen uh, I'd prefer it if you didn't call me [NAME].	0	Joey_16_1
Since I don't know anyone here, I thought it'd be cool to try out a cool work nickname.	0	Joey_16_2
Hey, dragon! Here's your tips from Monday and Tuesday.	0	A Waiter_16_3
There's like-there's like 300 bucks in this one!	6	Joey_16_4
Yeah, people get pretty generous around the holidays. And it never hurts to wear tight trousers.	0	The Waiter_16_5
Could the waiters gather around to hear tonight's specials?	0	Monica_16_6
Okay, first there is a Chilean Sea [NAME] prepared with a Mango relish on a bagWhy is nobody writing these down?	0	Monica_16_7
Because we can remember them.	0	The Waiter_16_8
Because your all gon na make up fake specials and make me cook them like you did the other night?	1	Monica_16_9
Hey. When you guys were kids and you played	0	Ross_17_0

Question. Was ah, Egg the Gellers! ' the war cry of your neighbourhood?	0	Joey_17_2
Ewww! Oh! It's the Mattress [NAME]!	2	Phoebe_17_3
Don't look honey. Change the channel! Change the channel!	2	Chandler_17_4
Wait! Wait! I wan na see this. After I divorce him, half of that kingdom is gon na be mine.	4	Janice_17_5
What a wank!	1	Chandler_17_6
Oh, I can not believe he's using our divorce to sell mattresses.	1	Janice_17_7
I know!	1	Monica_17_8
And four ninety-nine for a pillow top queen set, who cares about the divorce, those babies will sell themselves.	1	Monica_17_9
And I'm appalled for you by the way.	1	Monica_17_10
You had to do it, didn't you? You couldn't just leave it alone.	5	Rachel_17_11
Four percent. Okay. I tip more than that when there's a bug in my food.	2	Ross_17_12
[NAME], tonight was about the two of you getting along. Oh, would you just see my chiropractor, already.	1	Rachel_17_13
Yeah, I'm gon na go to a doctor who went to school in a mini-mall.	2	Ross_17_14
Hey Pheebs, what are you doing?	0	Ross_17_15
I'm, I'm freaking out!	3	Phoebe_17_16
[NAME] kinda trusted me with something and she shouldn't have!	3	Phoebe_17_17
All right, I haven't lived here in a while, so I have to ask you something.	0	Phoebe_17_18
Does [NAME] still turn on the lights in her bedroom?	0	Phoebe_17_19
Um. yeah.	0	Rachel_17_20

All right, look, here's the bottom line [NAME], this is fixable, if we act fast, okay.	0	Rachel_17_22
So, I'll invite him to brunch tomorrow and you can make nice.	0	Rachel_17_23
Look, honey, I have tried to make nice, it doesn't work.	1	Ross_17_24
Okay, look, [NAME], I realise that my Father is difficult, but that's why you have got to be the bigger man here.	0	Rachel_17_25
Look sweetie, I could be the bigger man, I could be the biggest man, I could be a big, huge, giant man, and it still wouldn't make any difference, except that I could pick your Father up and say Like me!	1	Ross_17_26
Like me tiny doctor! '	1	Ross_17_27
Okay, well can't you just try it one more time [NAME]? For me? For me?	5	Rachel_17_28
[NAME] one brunch is not gon na solve anything. You got ta face it, okay we're never gon na get along.	1	Ross_17_29
Okay, well you are just gon na have too, okay.	1	Rachel_17_30
Because I already got a Mother and a Father who can not stay in the same room together, okay, I don't wan na have to have a separate room for you too!	1	Rachel_17_31
Okay, okay, okay. I'll get the bagels.	0	Ross_17_32
Okay now [NAME], y'know that since you 're returning all of this stuff right after the audition you 're gon na have to wear underwear?	0	Rachel_18_0
All right, then you 'd better show me some of that too then.	0	Joey_18_1
Okay, it 's missing something. Ooh, I know! Umm, okay.	0	Rachel_18_2
Really? A purse?	6	Joey_19_0
It 's not a purse! It 's a shoulder bag.	1	Rachel_20_0
It looks like a women 's purse.	0	Joey_20_1
No [NAME], look. Trust me, all the men are wearing them in the spring catalog. Look. See look,	0	Rachel_20_2
See look,	0	Joey_20_3

No! No [NAME]! U-N-I-sex.	4	Rachel_20_6
Well, I ai n't gon na say no to that.	0	Joey_20_7
So, um, have you told your parents?	0	Phoebe_21_0
No, but it 'll be OK, they 're pretty cool, my brother 's straight so...	0	Duncan_21_1
Here you go.	0	Phoebe_21_2
You know what, I just have one more question, um, if you had figured this out sooner and um, I had been around, do you think that I would have been the one who.	0	Phoebe_21_3

Well, y'know, you and me, it had to end sometime.	5	Chandler_22_6
Why, exactly?	6	Monica_22_7
Because of the weekend, we had a fight.	5	Chandler_22_8
[NAME] that 's crazy!	6	Monica_22_9
If you give up every time you 'd have a fight with someone you 'd never be with anyone longer thanOhhh!	1	Monica_22_10

Okay, I was thinking we should have a beautiful guest room, right?	0	Monica_120_1
With a mahogany sleigh bed and bedside tables with flowers on them all the time!	4	Monica_120_2
And we could have a roll top desk with comment cards on them so people could say how much they loved staying here!!	4	Monica_120_3
Okay, whatever, I really haven't thought about it that much.	0	Monica_120_4
Well, I like that idea.	4	Chandler_120_5

No.	2	Monica_120_9
Okay so you mean no as in, `` [NAME], what an interesting idea. Let's discuss it before we reject it completely. ''	4	Chandler_120_10
Oh, I'm sorry. Of course I mean that. Interesting idea, umm, talk about it, but no.	2	Monica_120_11
So, that's it?	6	Chandler_120_12
I just don't think arcade games go in the beautiful guest room. The beautiful guest room is gon na be filled with antiques.	0	Monica_120_13
Which is why	0	Chandler_120_14
What do you have against the beautiful guest room?	1	Monica_120_15
I don't have anything against the beautiful guest room, especially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away!	1	Chandler_120_16

What? So now I'm not allowed to fire him?	6	Monica_123_10
You can't fire him and dump him the same day, he'll kill himself.	5	Phoebe_123_11
Okay well then, I'll fire him today and you go out with him for another week.	0	Monica_123_12

As bad as that went, I actually enjoyed myself. I think that I'm going to apologize for all of the stupid things I do.	0	Chandler_143_0
Why don't you just stop doing stupid things? Then you wouldn't have to apologize.	0	Monica_143_1

Yeah I know what I wanted to ask you.	0	Phoebe_151_2
Um, can you roll your tongue?	0	Phoebe_151_3
Because I can, and my Mom couldn't, and I thought y'know, I figured that was something I got from our Dad.	0	Phoebe_152_0
What, wait, you mean like this?	0	Frank_152_1
Yeah, yeah. You can do it to.	6	Phoebe_152_2
Your not doing it.	0	Frank_152_3
Oh right, yeah okay, my Mom could, and I can't. We don't have that....	0	Phoebe_152_4
Where there is no fear of commitment.	0	Ross_153_0
Do we have any... Do we have any thoughts here?	0	Chandler_153_1
Well, I 've never been through the tunnel myself, 'cause as I understand it, you 're not allowed to go through with more than one girl in the car, right.	0	Joey_153_2
But, it seems to me it 's pretty much like anything else, you know, face your fear.	0	Joey_153_3
It have a fear of heights, you go to the top of the building!	3	Joey_153_4
If you 're afraid of bugs.....get a bug.	0	Joey_153_5
Right.	0	Joey_153_6
In this case, you have a fear of commitment, so I say you go in there and be the most committed guy there ever was.	0	Joey_153_7
Amazingly, that makes sense.	4	Rachel_153_8
You think?	0	Chandler_153_9
Oh, yeah. Go for it man, jump off the high dive, stare down the barrel of the gun, pee into the wind!	4	Joey_153_10

Wow, it looks like a, like a holiday card y'know, with the tree in the middle and the skaters and the snow.	4	Ross_154_12
Y'know, every year I say I'm gon na send out holiday cards and I never do it.	0	Mona_154_13

Is this about [NAME]?	0	Ross_155_2
Oh my God.	6	Rachel_155_3
Okay, it's not, it's not.	0	Ross_155_4
Oh my God. I can not keep having this same fight with you [NAME]! Look, urrgh, maybe we should take a break.	5	Rachel_155_5
Fine, you're right.	0	Ross_155_6
Let's ah, let's take a break, let's cool off, okay, let's get some frozen yoghurt, or something..	0	Ross_155_7
No. A break from us.	5	Rachel_155_8
Bing! We're all set for tonight, 8 o'clock.	4	Doug_156_0
Oh uh, as it turns out, we can't do it. [NAME] has to work.	4	Chandler_156_1
Oh, my ex-wife didn't work, unless you call turning into her mother work. Fine. Tomorrow night then.	0	Doug_156_2
Oh uh well tomorrow's no good for her either.	0	Chandler_156_3
Oh? Why not?	0	Doug_156_4
It's the semi-finals of her botchy ball tournament.	0	Chandler_156_5
What's going on Bing? Does uh, your wife have a problem with me or something?	1	Doug_156_6
Well now-now you're just talking crazy.	4	Chandler_156_7
So why can't the three of us go out together?	0	Doug_156_8
Because uh we-we we split up. [NAME] and I split up. Hold me.	5	Chandler_156_9
[NAME] God Bing I well I can't say I'm altogether surprised, I saw the way she looked at you, and there was no love there.	5	Doug_156_10
And the way she looked at me, pure lust.	4	Doug_156_11
Y'know what would really help me through this tough time is choking something. Can I choke ya?	1	Chandler_156_12
Bing my boy, we're gon na get you over this.	0	Doug_156_13
Now here's the plan, grab your coat, we're going to a strip club.	4	Doug_156_14
Oh no-no-no, [NAME] would freak. But to hell with that bitch.	1	Chandler_156_15
Look at you, all sweet and innocent, sleeping like an angel... with [NAME] 's chubby little hands wrapped around ya.	0	Joey_157_0
It 's okay, [NAME], you stay asleep.	0	Joey_157_1
: Step away from the crib, I have a weapon!	1	Rachel_157_2
It 's okay, it 's okay Rach, it 's me. Put down the scrunchy.	0	Joey_157_3

There you go sweetie... This is n't over.	0	Joey_157_7
Did he call?	0	Joanna_158_0
No. Sorry.	5	Rachel_158_1
Why?! Why?! He said he'd call. Why hasn't he called?	5	Joanna_158_2
Maybe he's intimated by really smart, strong, successful women.	0	Sophie_158_3
[NAME], would you please climb out of my butt. Why hasn't he called, [NAME]? Why?	1	Joanna_158_4
Okay, okay. Umm, well ah, maybe he, maybe he feels awkward because you are my boss.	0	Rachel_158_5
Awkward? Why should he feel awkward?	6	Joanna_158_6
The only person that should feel awkward is you, and you didn't tell him not to call me, did you?	1	Joanna_159_0
Because if you feel uncomfortable with your friend dating someone you work for, there are always ways to fix... that.	1	Joanna_159_1
And you're upset because you didn't make your best friend cry?	5	Chandler_160_0
I mean, all I'm asking for is just a little emotion!	1	Monica_160_1
Is that too much to ask after six years?!	1	Monica_160_2
I mean what?	1	Monica_160_3
Are-are-are [NAME] and I not as close as you guys?!	1	Monica_160_4
I mean do we not have as much fun?!	1	Monica_160_5
Don't I deserve a few tears?!!	5	Monica_160_6

Hey!	1	Joey_160_8
I did not cry my eyes out!!	1	Joey_160_9
Come on!	5	Joey_160_10
It's like the end of an era!	5	Joey_160_11
No more J-man and Channie's!	5	Joey_160_12
Okay, I got ta ask, who calls us that?!	1	Chandler_160_13
Do I know why we're rushing?	0	Chloe_161_0

Oh, come on.	2	Monica_163_1
Hey!	5	Ross_163_2
All that stuff you said about true love, you were right, I mean, we did learn a lot from Mom and Dad!	4	Ross_163_3
And that picture of Chi-Chi with her mischievous grin.	0	Ross_163_4
And what you said about [NAME].	0	Ross_163_5
Ohh, yeah she really would've wanted to be there.	5	Ross_163_6
And you know what?	0	Ross_163_7
I think she was.	0	Ross_163_8
Oh good God, [NAME]! How the hell do you do it?	6	Monica_163_9
You forget how many great songs Heart had.	0	Joey_164_0
Yeah.	0	Chandler_164_1
You know, Barracuda was the first song I learned to play on the keyboard.	0	Ross_164_2
So, you heard it, you repeated it, so that must mean you wrote it.	0	Chandler_164_3
Oh, you guys, with this joke. I got ta say, I know I cracked up, but I'm not even sure I got it.	0	Joey_164_4
What, you didn't get it? The doctor is a monkey.	0	Ross_164_5
And monkeys can't write out prescriptions.	0	Chandler_164_6
You are not allowed to laugh at my joke.	1	Chandler_164_7
Your joke? Well, I think the Hef' would disagree, which is why he sent me a check for one hundred ah-dollars.	0	Ross_164_8
I can't find garbage bags!	1	Monica_165_0
Oh, I think I saw some in here.	0	Rachel_165_1
What is it?!	6	Monica_165_2
I don't know! But maybe if we keep that drawer shut, it'll die.	2	Rachel_165_3
I can't believe we're living here!	5	Monica_165_4
You still haven't told [NAME] you weren't really proposing?	6	Chandler_166_0
No! She had the ring on, she seemed so excited, and then she took her breast out.	1	Joey_166_1
[NAME], you have to tell her what's going on! And what did it look like?!	6	Chandler_166_2
I didn't look at it. Stupid baby's head was blocking most of it.	1	Joey_166_3
Go and tell [NAME] right now before [NAME] finds out.	5	Chandler_166_4
Look, it's not that easy. She said she wanted to marry me. I don't want to hurt her.	5	Joey_166_5
Okay, look, just do it gently.	0	Chandler_166_6
You're right.	0	Joey_166_7
You're right.	0	Joey_166_8
I-I'll go tell her now before [NAME] finds out and I'll be gentle.	0	Joey_166_9

How would you characterize the theme of this book, uh let 's see here, [NAME]?	0	The Teacher_167_2
Umm, well I would have to say that it 's a, it 's tragic love story.	0	Rachel_167_3
Well, that 's sort of a given, but yes. Anyone else?	0	The Teacher_167_4
Oh-oh-oh, symbolism! And uh, the-the uh, wildness of the mores, which	4	Rachel_167_5
Excellent! What [NAME] has shrewdly observed here	4	The Teacher_167_6
You completely stole my answer!	1	Phoebe_167_7
Well, honey that was pretty obvious.	5	Rachel_167_8
Well how would you know?! You did n't even read it!	1	Phoebe_167_9
What do you think? You in the blue shirt.	0	The Teacher_167_10
I think that uh, yours is a question with many answers.	0	Phoebe_167_11
Would ya care to venture one?	0	The Teacher_167_12
Would	0	Phoebe_167_13
Are you just repeating what I 'm saying?	1	The Teacher_167_14

There was a ring, in a box, on my nightstand, after you left, it was gone!	1	Joey_168_11
Wait, you guys think I stole some ring?	6	The Stripper_168_12
We know you took so just-just save yourself the time and confess!	1	Ross_168_13

I just found out this is Chandler's office! Come on [NAME], give me a hand!	4	Bob_209_1
[NAME], we said we would meet at the coffeehouse at six.	1	Monica_210_0
We said seven!	1	Chandler_210_1
We said six!	1	Monica_210_2
The only way that I said six would be if the seven's, let meet at seven, not at six.	0	Chandler_210_3
Yeah and if I had seven, maybe I would've said something like this, `` Wow! My boyfriend's such a wise assseven! ''	1	Monica_210_4
Hi!	4	Phoebe_210_5
Oh my good God.	2	Chandler_210_6
I know what time you said.	4	Phoebe_210_7
What?!	6	Chandler_210_8
Well actually, I know what time [NAME] and [NAME] said.	0	Phoebe_210_9
You, get out of my shop!	1	The Dry Cleaner_211_0
Well, what did he do?	6	Phoebe_211_1
He went out with my wife!	1	The Dry Cleaner_211_2

Well, we should go.	0	Phoebe_211_6
Yeah.	0	Joey_211_7
Y'know you, really didn't have to take me to the airport.	0	Chandler_212_0
Oh please.	0	Janice_212_1
Every moment is precious.	5	Janice_212_2
Y'know?	0	Janice_212_3
Besides, somebody had to ride in that other taxi with the rest of your luggage, and your friends don't really seem to care too much that you're leaving.	5	Janice_212_4
Well, we're really not that close. Okay, so I guess this is uh, good-bye then.	0	Chandler_212_5
On no! No! It's not good-bye, I'm not leaving until you get on that plane.	5	Janice_212_6
No, I'm afraid I won't be able to make love as well as him.	1	Chandler_213_0
Yeah, I was going for the metaphor.	0	Ross_213_1
Yes, and I was saying the actual words.	0	Chandler_213_2
So big deal, so Joey's had a lot of girlfriends, it doesn't mean he's great in bed.	0	Monica_213_3
We share a wall! So either he's great in bed, or she just likes to agree with him a lot.	0	Chandler_213_4
Sweetie, with you it's gon na be different. The sex is gon na be great, cause you-you guys are in love.	4	Monica_213_5

Yeah, you should, really.	0	Rachel_213_10
All right, all right, I'll go sleep with my girlfriend. But I'm just doing it for you guys.	0	Chandler_213_11
: I'm sure as hell a dancer, it's no use [NAME] will never go for me.	5	Mr. Treeger_214_0
Come on Treeger, don't say that.	5	Joey_214_1
You just ahh, you just need more practice.	0	Joey_214_2
Here, come on, let's ahh, let's try it again.	0	Joey_214_3
Plus, it was, it was probably mostly my fault, anyway.	5	Joey_214_4
I mean, y'know, I'm not really that comfortable dancing with a We-he!!	4	Joey_214_5
Hey!	4	Joey_214_6

Are you sure? I'll bet there's another flight to Minsk in like	0	Phoebe_215_0
July. Umm,	0	David_215_1
That's really beautiful. What does it mean?	4	Phoebe_215_2
Please, clean my beakers. I don't get out of the lab much.	0	David_215_3
That's good. I got to admit, I thought it was something else.	4	Phoebe_215_4
Yeah, I Well I really actually wanted to say umm, that, but um, I figured I probably shouldn't because y'know, I have to leave.	0	David_215_5
You're right! You're right. Don't say it.	5	Phoebe_215_6
I-I do though.	5	David_215_7
I do too.	5	Phoebe_215_8
Bye [NAME].	0	David_215_9
Okay, now's not the time [NAME]. All right? You can yell at me tomorrow.	5	Phoebe_215_10
Yeah, I-I heard. I think it's great! Ohh, I'm so happy for you!	4	Rachel_216_0
I can't believe you're getting married!	4	Monica_216_1
Yeah.	0	Ross_216_2
[NAME] and [NAME] made out.	0	Joey_216_3
Ohhh!	6	Rachel_217_0
Why are we in bed together?	6	Ross_217_1
I don't know. Do-do you have any clothes on?	0	Rachel_217_2
Yeah.	0	Ross_217_3
Really?!	6	Rachel_217_4
No!	0	Ross_217_5
But we-we didn't have sex-uh, did we?	3	Ross_217_6
I mean, I don't remember much about last night, it was such a blur.	0	Ross_217_7
Oh! I remember laughing! I laughed a lot.	4	Rachel_217_8
And we didn't have sex.	0	Ross_217_9
Ohh, I mean, we were really drunk. I'm just glad we didn't do anything stupid.	0	Rachel_217_10
Tell me about it.	0	Ross_217_11
What are we gon na do?	0	Monica_218_0

I got new sheets!	4	Rachel_222_6
I'm making him a	4	Rachel_222_7
What am I making him by the way?	0	Rachel_222_8
Well, you're making him a frieze salad with goat cheese and pine nuts, wild nuts, wild rice, roast asparagus, and salmon au croup.	0	Monica_222_9
I thought I was making him filet mignon?	6	Rachel_222_10
Yeah, you were, but you decided to make salmon because you had some left over at the restaurant.	0	Monica_222_11
And then you realised if you bitched about it, then you would stop cooking, and you would have to make your famous baked potato and Diet Coke.	1	Monica_222_12
Wow, I really get crabby when I cook.	6	Rachel_222_13
[NAME]! It happens to lots of guys! You-you-you were probably tired, you had a lot of champagne, don't worry about it!	5	Monica_223_0
I'm not worried, I'm uh, I'm fascinated.	3	Chandler_223_1
Y'know it's like uh, Biology!	0	Chandler_223_2
Which is funny because in high school I uh, I-I failed Biology and tonight Biology failed me.	3	Chandler_223_3
Check it out. Okay, I can play this when the guests are coming in. Okay.	0	Phoebe_223_4
[NAME]!	4	Monica_223_5
If you would've let me finish, it goes on to say that he's probably not gay.	0	Phoebe_223_6
You are falling fast asleep.	0	Hypnosis Tape_224_0
Deeper.	0	Hypnosis Tape_224_1
Deeper.	0	Hypnosis Tape_224_2
Deeper.	0	Hypnosis Tape_224_3
You are now completely asleep.	0	Hypnosis Tape_224_4
You don't need to smoke.	0	Hypnosis Tape_224_5
Cigarettes don't control you.	0	Hypnosis Tape_224_6
You are a strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke.	0	Hypnosis Tape_224_7
A strong, confident woman.	0	Hypnosis Tape_224_8
Thank you for your patience, you're the next caller.	0	Hold Voice_225_0
Yes!! Yes!! I'm the next caller! You were gon na have me hang up.	4	Phoebe_225_1
Hey! Can you take a duck and a chick to the theatre?	0	Chandler_225_2
Of course not.	5	Monica_225_3
No.	0	Phoebe_225_4
Okay. I just wanted them to hear it from somebody else.	0	Chandler_225_5
So how are things going with [NAME]?	0	Phoebe_226_0
[NAME].	4	Rachel_226_1
Although y'know, he-he's a private guy.	0	Rachel_226_2
Y'know, I wish I could get him to open up a little bit, share some feelings.	5	Rachel_226_3
That's easy! You just have to think of him as a-as a jar of pickles that won't open.	0	Phoebe_226_4
So what are you saying. I should run him under hot water and bang his head against a table?	6	Rachel_226_5
No that's what you do when you want to get the truth out of someone.	0	Phoebe_226_6
Hi honey.	0	Paul_226_7
Hi!	4	Rachel_226_8
Okay, [NAME], I won't tell your daddy that you had ice cream for dinner, if you don't tell about our little bonking incident.	3	Monica_227_0
[NAME], number one, I don't think [NAME] understands the concept of bribery, and number two, I... What?!	6	Rachel_227_1
You said number two.	0	Joey_227_2
I also said number one.	0	Rachel_227_3
Remind me to review with you which pot is decaf and which is regular.	0	Gunther_228_0
Can't I just look at the handles on them?	0	Rachel_228_1
You would think.	0	Gunther_228_2
Okay, fine.	0	Rachel_228_3
Gunther, y'know what, I am a terrible waitress, do you know why I'm a terrible waitress?	1	Rachel_228_4
Because, I don't care.	0	Rachel_228_5
I don't care.	0	Rachel_228_6
I don't care which pot is regular and which pot is decaf, I don't care where the tray spot is, I just don't care, this is not what I want to do.	1	Rachel_228_7
So I don't think I should do it anymore.	5	Rachel_228_8
I'm gon na give you my weeks notice.	5	Rachel_228_9
What?!	6	Gunther_228_10
Gunther, I quit.	5	Rachel_228_11

Oh, I probably shouldn'tso I will! Oh! Wow! It's like it's raining!	6	Rachel_229_4
Pretty cool, huh?	4	Joey_229_5
But if you're thinking you can put a fish in there and it wouldn't get sucked up into the mechanism, well you'd be wrong.	0	Joey_229_6
Umm, can I use your bathroom?	0	Rachel_229_7
It's uh, right through there.	0	Joey_229_8
Okay. God y'know, if someone told me a week ago that I would be peeing in [NAME] Tribbiani's apartment	4	Rachel_229_9
Yeah, life's pretty great isn't it?	4	Joey_229_10
You know, I think I was sixteen.	0	Joey_230_0
Please, just a little bit off the back.	0	Monica_230_1

If they can't find a home for her, they kill her! And I'm not gon na let that happen to little [NAME]!	1	Chandler_231_8
Okay, good, good, good, cause, good, cause I was kinda having second thoughts too.	3	Joey_231_9

I 'm sorry there was n't better news from your test last week but I wanted to talk to you about your options.	0	Doctor Connelly_268_6

Above all, even though your chances of conceiving through natural means are n't great, you never know!	0	Doctor Connelly_268_8
So, keep having sex on a regular basis.	0	Doctor Connelly_268_9
Oh, DAMN IT!	1	Chandler_268_10
Do n't worry, after a while he 'll tune it out.	0	Monica_268_11
Ok, given your situation, the options with the greatest chances for success would be surrogacy, or insemination using a sperm donor.	0	Doctor Connelly_268_12
Ok.	0	Monica_268_13
Well, y'know, monogamy can be a, uh, tricky concept. I mean, anthropologically speaking-	0	Ross_269_0

Ok. Wow, you guys sure have a lot of books about bein'a lesbian.	6	Ross_270_8
Well, you know, you have to take a course. Otherwise, they do n't let you do it.	0	Susan_270_9
Hey, hey, Yertle the Turtle. A classic.	4	Ross_270_10
Actually, I 'm reading it to the baby.	0	Susan_270_11
The uh, the baby that has n't been born yet? Would n't that mean you 're... crazy?	6	Ross_270_12
What, you do n't think they can hear sounds in there?	4	Susan_270_13
You 're not serious, I mean, you really... you really talk to it?	6	Ross_270_14

Yeah, I mean, come on [NAME], no one will even notice. I mean they're probably not even listening!	0	Rachel_279_11
They're not listening too me?	6	Ross_279_12
Of course they're listening to you! Everybody listens to you.	0	Rachel_279_13
